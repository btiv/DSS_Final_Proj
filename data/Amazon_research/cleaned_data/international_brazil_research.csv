In particular, we assessed two significant potential impacts: (i) the loss of government revenue due to the sale of public land below market prices and (ii) the risk of future deforestation and associated CO2 emissions in 19.6 million hectares allocated to expand land privatization. The short-term revenue loss ranges from U$ 5 to 8 billion for 8.6 million hectares; the future revenue loss ranges from U$ 16.7 to 23.8 billion for 19.6 million hectares; and between 1.1 and 1.6 million hectares would risk being deforested until 2027, which could emit 4.5-6.5 megatonnes of CO2.

Based on data from the Machadinho settlement project, Rondnia, we show that most settlers had no knowledge about the agricultural capability of the area, did not receive technical information, could not afford agricultural inputs, planted inadequate crops in the early years of occupation, and did not manage to stay in their plot for a long period of time. Satellite images indicated that patches of land with good soil quality were not necessarily the first to be utilized. Inadequately planned settlements face many challenges (poor soil being one of them) and are likely to result in land turnover, conversion of land into pasture, land concentration among wealthier persons, invasion of areas by poorer people, and deforestation, defying the main purpose of agrarian reform.","[Castro, Marcia C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Singer, Burton H.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL USA",,"Castro, MC (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, 665 Huntington Ave,Bldg 1,Room 1113, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",mcastro@hsph.harvard.edu,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2012.0,34.0,1,,,,22.0,43,,10.1007/s11111-011-0162-0,,,,,,,,WOS:000308394000003,

Using a high-resolution time series of land cover maps (classified as mature forest, non-forest, secondary forest) spanning from 1984 through 2011, and four uncorrelated fragmentation metrics (edge density, clumpiness index, area-weighted mean patch size and shape index), we examined the temporal and spatial dynamics of forest fragmentation in three study areas across the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santar,m and Machadinho d'Oeste), inside and outside conservation units. Moreover, we compared the impacts on the landscape of: (1) different land uses (e.g. cattle ranching, crop production), (2) occupation processes (spontaneous vs. planned settlements) and (3) implementation of conservation units. By 2010/2011, municipalities located along the Arc of Deforestation had more than 55% of the remaining mature forest strictly confined to conservation units. Further, the planned settlement showed a higher rate of forest loss, a more persistent increase in deforested areas and a higher relative incidence of deforestation inside conservation units. Distinct agricultural activities did not lead to significantly different landscape structures; the accessibility of the municipality showed greater influence in the degree of degradation of the landscapes. Even with a high proportion of the landscapes covered by conservation units, which showed a strong inhibitory effect on forest fragmentation, we show that dynamic agriculturally driven economic activities, in municipalities with extensive road development, led to more regularly shaped, heavily fragmented landscapes, with higher densities of forest edge.","[Rosa, Isabel M.

We use the database on deforestation published by the Brazilian space research center (INPE) and the population census data released by the federal geographical and statistical agency IBGE at their finest scale: the census tract level. By crossing the population density and deforestation variables, we identify ten human settlement patterns in the Amazon. There are low-low and high-high classes of population density and deforestation, but also low-high and high-low classes. This analysis helps understand the low overall relations in the Amazon for population and deforestation. We emphasize the expansion of large-scale agriculture and cattle ranching as causing the depopulation of rural areas while in many regions of the Amazon quite strong population densities coexist with relatively low extents of deforestation. Such findings stress the need to implement case-specific public policies in these regions in order to encourage human presence compatible With the conservation of forest cover and biodiversity. We also confirm the importance of the Amazon urbanization process, including the 'discrete urbanization' of rural areas, and the need to better recognize the distinct social and environmental problems of urban areas.

In the Brazilian Amazon, land-use changes increase fire occurrence, especially in fragmented forests close to managed land. We used remote sensing imagery to estimate the extent and impact of forest fires in degraded tropical rain-forest in the Brazilian Legal Amazon between 2007 and 2010 and examined land-use establishing in degraded areas. The trends in degraded area vs. burned area were different. Even though degradation increased one year after a high fire year, there was no spatial overlap, which points to other causes for degradation. Up to 11% of the degraded area was burned in the same year, playing escaping fires from managed and deforested lands a significant role in degradation by fire. Eighty-four percent of 2007s degraded area remained forest one year later, whereas the rest was identified as deforestation, secondary vegetation or pasture. Three years after degradation, 80% remained forest, the proportion of deforested area decreased and areas in regeneration after being deforested increased. Monitoring of forest degradation across tropical forests is critical for developing land management policies and for carbon stocks/emissions estimation.","[Viegas, Domingos Xavier] Univ Coimbra, ADAI CEIF, Coimbra, Portugal",,"Viegas, DX (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, ADAI CEIF, Coimbra, Portugal.",,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2014.0,,,,,,1582.0,1591,,10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6_174,10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6,,,,,,,WOS:000400252000175,

Interviews were held with land users in Acre state, a municipality with high rates of deforestation located in the forest frontier of the Brazilian Amazon. Critical legal geography was applied as a theoretical framework to investigate the ways in which legal meaning emerges in and through that social context. This research finds that non-compliance is associated with pervasive conditions of social stress combined with lived experiences of contradictory legal processes, including shifting legal discourses and inconsistent local law enforcement. In such social contexts, local legal meaning associates forest conservation laws with socio-economic and legal inequality and the reinforcement of structures of social exclusion.","[Schmidt, Caroline A.; McDermott, Constance L.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",,"Schmidt, CA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",caroline.schmidt@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,14,15,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2015.0,24.0,1,,,,3.0,24,,10.1177/0964663914552213,,,,,,,,WOS:000349326200001,

Across Amazonia, groups who once opposed or were displaced by cattle are now adopting it-including Acrean rubber tappers and colonists. Drawing on primary data collected among rural and urban groups in Acre, I explain how cattle culture emerged in a state with a short and contested history with cattle raising. I focus specifically on the relationship between the cattle economy and cattle culture through analysis of three processes: local subsistence practices resulting in symbolic associations; the diffusion of market-oriented ranching and the dominant cauboi (cowboy) culture, and the ways that the two overlap and are negotiated among Acrean groups.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Hoelle, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,,8,9,,,,,,,,,,,WIN,2014.0,73.0,4,,,,363.0,374,,10.17730/humo.73.4.u61u675428341165,,,,,,,,WOS:000345516100007,

We find that in traditional households, economic variables such as the opportunity cost of household time, market conditions, and the hiring wage are important predictors of these decisions, as is household reliance on standing forest resources for non-timber products. Our results confirm that traditional households actively engage in fire prevention, and suggest that fire prevention is motivated by a desire to protect agricultural plantations as well as standing forest reserves.

The large area extent of fire prone areas associated with human activities makes satellite remote sensing of active fires a valuable tool to help monitor biomass burning in those regions. However, identification of active fire fronts under optically thick clouds is not possible through passive remote sensing, often resulting in omission errors. Previous analyses of fire activity either ignored the cloud obscuration problem or applied corrections based on the assumption that fire occurrence is not impacted by the presence of clouds. In this study we addressed the cloud obscuration problem in the Brazilian Amazon region using a pixel based probabilistic approach, using information on previous fire occurrence, precipitation and land use. We implemented the methodology using data from the geostationary GOES imager, covering the entire diurnal cycle of fire activity and cloud occurrence. Our assessment of the method indicated that the cloud adjustment reproduced the number of potential fires missed within 1.5% and 5% of the true fire counts on annual and monthly bases respectively. Spatially explicit comparison with high resolution burn scar maps in Acre state showed a reduction of omission error (from 58.3% to 43.7%) and only slight increase of commission error (from 6.4% to 8.8%) compared to uncorrected fire counts.

Results from a few experiments, case studies, and surveys have been groundbreaking, but are insufficient. A strategic partnership between timber companies and research organizations is needed to generate additional information. This paper presents a tool for monitoring production and costs of forest operations to facilitate such collaboration. The tool provides useful information for companies and, at the same time, generates reliable data for research. Selected results are presented on production, capacity, and costs to demonstrate the usefulness of the information that can be generated. These results are based on the first 2 years of implementation by a company in the State of Para, Brazil. This pilot project confirmed that the tool is simple and relevant. Its successful implementation requires significant investment, and will be applicable only to companies interested in changing from conventional logging to reduced-impact logging, especially those seeking Forest Stewardship Council certification. Successful implementation of the tool will also depend on it generating readily understood and highly relevant results for the companies, and receiving extensive support during the first 2 years.","Univ Freiburg, D-7800 Freiburg, Germany",,"Pokorny, B (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, D-7800 Freiburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2005.0,10.0,1,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,WOS:000230237900026,

Data from 126 rural familial properties in the region around the city of Santarem, Pari, in the Brazilian Amazon, indicate that property size is important for understanding the trajectories of land cover change. Past research has focused on the distinction between small family farms and large capitalized farms, arguing that family farmers have a higher deforestation intensity, or on estimating the strength of the effect of property size relative to economic or demographic factors. This paper shows that larger familial properties are able both to retain a larger area in forest and to have long enough cycles of use and fallow to allow previously used land to become forested again. Based on these analyses and discussion, we argue that land use and land cover research must consider property size as an organizing principle in order to better comprehend the reciprocal relationship between population and environment in frontier areas of the Brazilian Amazon and other rural landscapes.","Indiana Univ, Anthropol Ctr Training & Res Global Environm Chan, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",,"D'Antona, AO (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Anthropol Ctr Training & Res Global Environm Chan, Student Bldg Rm 331, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",adantona@indiana.edu,,,,,,,30,37,,,,,,,,,,,MAY-JUL,2006.0,27.0,5-6,,,,373.0,396,,10.1007/s11111-006-0031-4,,,,,,,,WOS:000242634000001,

In this article we turn our analytical lenses to another, less examined effect of Amazon land use and environmental change, namely, the creation and development of new urban areas. Here we argue that urban growth in the Amazon is a direct residual of international interest in the production of traded commodities and of the capacity of local urban residents to capture capital and value before it is extracted from the region. Specifically, we suggest that urban growth is occurring fastest where cities have access to both rural export commodities and export corridors. We also show correlations between urban growth and lower rural population density and cities' capacities to draw migrants from beyond their immediate rural surroundings. More broadly, we argue that urbanization in the Amazon is better interpreted as a symptom rather than a driver of the region's land use and land cover change.","[Richards, Peter; VanWey, Leah] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Populat Studies & Training Ctr, Providence, RI 02912 USA",,"Richards, P (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Populat Studies & Training Ctr, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",peter_richards@brown.edu; Leah_Vanwey@brown.edu,,,,,,,28,31,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 4,2015.0,105.0,4,,,,806.0,823,,10.1080/00045608.2015.1052337,,,,,,,,WOS:000359478600011,

A two-step econometric approach is adopted. A bootstrapped translog stochastic frontier that is a posteriori checked for functional consistency is used to assess technical efficiency and these estimates are put into a land-use model to assess the impact of productivity on deforestation. Analysis of agricultural census tract data suggests that technical efficiency has a U-shaped effect: both less and more efficient farms use more land for their agricultural activities and so have a positive effect on deforestation. However, the majority of farms in the BLA are on the ascendant slope, so that efficiency implies more deforestation in the BLA. The poor environmental valuation of the Brazilian forest, the uneven land distribution, and the problem of the de facto openly accessed forested and unproductive lands in the BLA could explain the U-shaped effect of technical efficiency on the conversion of forested land into agricultural land.

It describes the local understanding of malaria, strategies to distinguish the illness from other febrile sicknesses, challenges for detecting the disease through biomedical diagnosis methods, and vicissitudes of having malaria. It draws on cases from ribeirinhos from a peri-urban community of Manaus and a rural community from Careiro, State of Amazonas, Brazil. Although malaria is biomedically characterized by the pathogens causing the disease, ribeirinhos have developed other standards to define malaria, including the intensity of the symptoms, the interval between the infections, and the types of medications dispensed to them. In the riverine communities studied, the etiology of malaria includes mosquitoes, microbes, water, wind, sun, and person-to-person transmission. Symptoms of malaria were found to overlap with other febrile sicknesses; hence, ribeirinhos developed skills to monitor how a malaise unfolds in their bodies. Experiential knowledge plays a key role in the early detection of malaria. Individuals who have no previous experience with malaria were found to spend more time seeking health care. Equally important, ribeirinhos perceive that malaria is part of the landscape they inhabit.","[de Souza, Luciane Machado Freitas] Univ Ottawa, Interdisciplinary Sch Hlth Sci, Fac Hlth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",,"de Souza, LMF (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Interdisciplinary Sch Hlth Sci, Fac Hlth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",lmach031@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 9,2017.0,2.0,,,,,410.0,428,,10.1139/facets-2016-0063,,,,,,,,WOS:000409851000001,

A growing debate considers the extent to which deforestation is a result of the expansion of the Brazilian soy industry. Most recent analyses suggest that deforestation is driven by the expansion of cattle ranching, rather than soy. Soy seems to be replacing previously deforested land and/or land previously under pasture. In this study, we use municipality-level statistics on agricultural and deforested areas across the Legal Amazon from 2000 to 2006 to examine the spatial patterns and statistical relationships between deforestation and changes in pasture and soybean areas. Our results support previous studies that showed that deforestation is predominantly a result of pasture expansion. However, we also find support for the hypothesis that an increase of soy in Mato Grosso has displaced pasture further north, leading to deforestation elsewhere. Although not conclusive, our findings suggest that the debate surrounding the drivers of Amazon deforestation is not over, and that indirect causal links between soy and deforestation may exist that need further exploration. Future research should examine more closely how interlinkages between land area, prices, and policies influence the relationship between soy and deforestation, in order to make a conclusive case for 'displacement deforestation'.","[Barona, Elizabeth; Ramankutty, Navin; Coomes, Oliver T.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Barona, Elizabeth; Hyman, Glenn] CIAT, Cali, Colombia",,"Ramankutty, N (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",navin.ramankutty@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,319,323,,,,,,,,,,,APR-JUN,2010.0,5.0,2,,,,,,24002,10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002,,,,,,,,WOS:000279369500003,

To this end, we consider (1) the land-use dynamics of smallholder households, (2) the formation of pasture by large-scale ranchers, and (3) structural processes of land aggregation by ranchers. Much has been written about relation between smallholders and ranchers in the Brazilian Amazon, particularly those involving conflict over land, and this article explicates the implications of such social processes for land cover. Toward this end, we draw on panel data (1996-2002) and satellite imagery (1986-1999) to show the deforestation that is attributable to small- and largeholders, and the deforestation that is attributable to aggregations of property arising from a process that we refer to as frontier stratification. Evidently, most of the recent deforestation in the study area has resulted from the household processes of smallholders, not from conversions to pasture pursuant to the appropriations of smallholders' property by well-capitalized ranchers or speculators.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Peace Corps Masters Int Program, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Sociol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Aldrich, SP (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, 116 Geog Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.",aldric30@msu.edu; rwalker@msu.edu; arimaeug@msu.edu; caldasma@msu.edu; browder@vt.edu; sperz@soc.ufl.edu,,,,,,,71,78,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2006.0,82.0,3,,,,265.0,288,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000240013200002,

However, in humid tropical regions where water is relatively abundant and the terrain is relatively flat, it is unclear whether these changes in ecosystem services matter to local farmers. We test whether the extent of forest in upstream drainage areas affects downstream farm production in an agricultural colonization zone in the Brazilian Amazon. We first estimate panel models of the output of milk, which is the primary farm product in our study region. We then test for effects on pasture stocking and cow productivity as possible pathways for the effect of upstream forests on milk output. Estimation results suggest that upstream forest increases the productivity of properties with small drainage areas. The effects are strongest when water is either scarce (dry season of drought years) or excessive (rainy season of flood years). The contribution of Amazonian forests to the resilience of the local farm economy is likely to become more important as rainfall becomes more variable due to regional and global climate change.","[Wu, Yu] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA; [Mullan, Katrina] Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Biggs, Trent] San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill] Salisbury Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill] Salisbury Univ, Environm Studies Dept, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Harris, Daniel W.] Salisbury Univ, Dept Geog & Geosci, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Sills, Erin O.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,"Wu, Y (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.",yuwu5@unc.edu,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021.0,183.0,,,,,,,106965,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.106965,,FEB 2021,,,,,,WOS:000633443400014,

What makes Brazil's fertility decline particularly interesting is its strong reliance on a nonreversible method of contraception: tubal ligation, here referred to as female sterilization. As recently as 1996, the country led the world in recorded rates of female sterilization. This practice is so pervasive and dominant that among some Brazilian scholars it has come to be called the surgical transition rather than the fertility transition. In this paper, we discuss the prevalence of female sterilization and other contraceptive methods among rural women of the Lower Amazon. The use of reversible (e.g., the pill, condoms) and irreversible (sterilization) methods is analyzed in terms of women's birth cohorts and in terms of their individual characteristics.

This process has been extensively described and modelled, but as yet there has been no formal test of how the spatial patterns of deforested and fragmented areas change with the spatial scale of forest clearings. It was hypothesised that different land-use practices are driving small and large clearings, with small-scale cultivators often creating small, irregularly shaped clearings and large-scale ranchers and soy farmers creating larger, more regular-shaped clearings. To quantitatively test this hypothesis, Mandelbrot's theory of fractals was applied to deforested areas in the Brazilian Amazon to test for scale-invariance in deforestation patterns. The spatial pattern of deforestation differed between small and large clearings, with the former creating more complex landscapes and with a threshold occurring at c. 1200 ha in area. As a consequence, the sizes and shapes of forest clearings, and hence the relative vulnerability of the remaining forest to edge, area and isolation effects, may differ systematically between landscapes with different deforestation drivers.

Land reform tends to promote land redistribution through regularization of smallholder land invasions of large-scale landholdings, and by redistribution of public lands to smallholders in existing colonization frontiers. The implications of state-led land reform on deforestation are heterogeneous. I argue that impacts of agrarian reform are strongly related to the pre-existing social and economic configuration Of the Frontiers where it takes place. While it leads to lower rates of deformation in landscapes dominated by smallholders with diversified land use, its impact on forest conversion is higher in landscapes where extensive land use, mainly prompted by large-scale cattle ranching, tends to dominate.

As a consequence, recent studies rejected the widely agreed boom-and-bust development hypothesis that deforestation first generates an economic boom, which is then followed by a collapse as forest resources are depleted. Here, we confirm these studies that there is no boom-bust cycle and suggest that a new pattern of relationship between deforestation and socio-economic development has emerged following an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). In this scenario, environmental degradation increases in the early stages of economic development and decreases in later stages as the economy develops and wellbeing increases. To validate this assumption, we conducted the first sub-municipal analysis of socio-economic development and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon for the 2000-2010 period. Our results confirm the emergence of an EKC relationship with a turning point beyond which socio-economic growth does not appear anymore to be a driver of deforestation. We also emphasize that areas subjected to active deforestation in 2010 present lower socio-economic indicators than stabilized areas, pointing to the precarious socio-economic situation of areas still undergoing active deforestation. We put these results in perspective by considering Brazilian efforts to ensure a transition in environmental governance with the objective of promoting land use sustainability through control of deforestation at the same time as supporting socio-economic development.

Characteristics are: direct conversions from forest to pasture; regional processes of indirect land-use change, described by the conversion of pastures to cropland, which increases the demand for pastures elsewhere; and teleconnections, fueled by the global demands for soybeans as animal fodder. We modeled land-use changes for two scenarios Trend and Sustainable Development for a hot spot of land-use change along the BR-163 highway in Mato Grosso and Para, Brazil. We investigated the differences between a coupled modeling approach, which incorporates indirect land-use change processes, and a noncoupled land-use model. We coupled the regional-scale LandSHIFT model, defined for Mato Grosso and Para, with a subregional model, alucR, covering a selected corridor along the BR-163. The results indicated distinct land-use scenario outcomes from the coupled modeling approach and the subregional model quantification. We found the highest deforestation estimates returned from the subregional quantification of the Trend scenario. This originated from the strong local dynamics of past deforestation and land-use changes. Land-use changes exceeded the demands estimated at regional scale. We observed the lowest deforestation estimates at the subregional quantification of the Sustainable Development story line. We highlight that model coupling increased the representation of scenario outcomes at fine resolution while providing consistency across scales. However, distinct local dynamics were explicitly captured at subregional scale.

This paper aims to identify socio-climatic hotspots among the 515 municipalities that compose the Brazilian Amazon by using a three-step process. First, we identified the regional social hotspots, that is, municipalities that have currently low adaptive capacity, by calculating a composite infrastructure index based on the assessment of both current green and socioeconomic infrastructures. Second, we used a Regional Climate Change Index to identify the climate change hotspots, that is, those municipalities that have a high likelihood to experience future climate change risks. Third, we evaluated the geographic coincidence of social and climate change hotspots to identify the socio-climatic hotspots. We found that 117 municipalities are regional social hotspots and that 60 municipalities are regional climate change hotspots. Forty-six municipalities are considered as socio-climatic hotspots because they have very low to low composite infrastructure indices and very high climate risk indices. Local institutional capacity to integrate and execute national-level policies that enhance local adaptive capacity is a major constraint across the region. To face the challenges associated with climate change, municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon should embrace a more sustainable development model. Sustainable development, in the context of the Brazilian Amazon, implies conservation of the existing green infrastructure through the expansion of protected areas and indigenous lands, restoration of green infrastructure in areas of deficit, and substantial investments in urban socioeconomic infrastructures to foster a knowledge-based economy. Although local sustainable development and adaptation plans are essential across the entire region, the 46 municipalities identified in this study as regional socio-climatic hotspots could be prioritized for action.","[da Silva, Jose Maria Cardoso; Prasad, Shivangi] Univ Miami, Dept Geog, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",,"da Silva, JMC (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Dept Geog, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",jcsilva@miami.edu,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 7,2019.0,11.0,2,,,,153.0,166,,10.1080/17565529.2017.1411242,,,,,,,,WOS:000459266100005,

We provide the first submunicipality assessment, to our knowledge, of actor-specific contributions to the deforestation slowdown by linking agricultural census and remote-sensing data on deforestation and forest degradation. Almost half (36,158 km(2)) of the deforestation between 2004 and 2011 occurred in areas dominated by larger properties (> 500 ha), whereas only 12% (9,720 km(2)) occurred in areas dominated by smallholder properties (< 100 ha). In addition, forests in areas dominated by smallholders tend to be less fragmented and less degraded. However, although annual deforestation rates fell during this period by 68-85% for all actors, the contribution of the largest landholders (> 2,500 ha) to annual deforestation decreased over time (63% decrease between 2005 and 2011), whereas that of smallholders went up by a similar amount (69%) during the same period. In addition, the deforestation share attributable to remote areas increased by 88% between 2009 and 2011. These observations are consistent across the Brazilian Amazon, regardless of geographical differences in actor dominance or socioenvironmental context. Our findings suggest that deforestation policies to date, which have been particularly focused on command and control measures on larger properties in deforestation hotspots, may be increasingly limited in their effectiveness and fail to address all actors equally. Further reductions in deforestation are likely to be increasingly costly and require actor-tailored approaches, including better monitoring to detect small-scale deforestation and a shift toward more incentive-based conservation policies.","[Godar, Javier; Gardner, Toby A.] Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tizado, E.

This article analyzes the operation of the Mission, specifically its fishery and forestry sections, to understand the dynamics of transnational development cooperation. The mission eventually failed because the Brazilian state never offered sufficient support on FAO terms; SPVEA never acquired the necessary financial resources, administrative capacity and technical expertise. The FAO experts recognized the problems, but had no means to enhance the resources or change the approach of the local partner. The government's decision, in the late 1950s, to prioritize the building of a major road from Brasilia to Belem, aggravated the lack of resources for the Mission's work.

Previous studies suggest that the contentious social processes inherent in the Brazilian land tenure and land reform system cause a significant amount of deforestation. An environment of insecure land title, and policies that value deforested land over forested land, among other factors, encourage both landholders and squatters to deforest more land than is necessary for pasture or crop production. This paper examines the impact that land occupations have on deforestation at the municipal scale across the Brazilian Legal Amazon, from 2000 to 2009. We show that land occupations have a direct influence on deforestation. We use spatial analysis as well to show that land occupations have a spatial component in the effect on deforestation: occupations in one municipality affect deforestation in adjacent areas.

We examine Amazon-wide, sub-regional, settlement, and farm-level deforestation trajectories in the Brazilian Amazon and suggest factors that underlie level-dependent differences in spatial patterns and temporal magnitudes of deforestation from 1970 to 2001. At a sub-regional level, we find significant variation in frequency, magnitude, and intensity of deforestation associated with context-specific processes, including areas that have stopped deforesting, are rapidly reforesting, while at the same time increasing economic value of forest-based production. We use remote-sensing data from 1970 to 2001. For Amazon-wide and state-level analyses, we use data available from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research. For sub-regional, settlement, and farm-lot levels, time-series Landsat images and aerial photographs and detailed field-based research are used to reconstruct the history of deforestation.

The two most important factors currently shaping cattle ranching evolution in this region are gradual market integration and the associated shifting policy contexts. Based on these two broader contextual factors, this article analyzes four main specific trends shaping the production and trade dynamics in the cattle sector. The first trend is growing investment in beef and dairy processing facilities situated closer to production zones. The second trend is gradual improvement in cattle herds and management systems alongside persistently extensive cattle ranching. The third is simultaneous fragmentation and concentration of landholdings. The fourth is widespread adoption of ranching by smallholders. These four trends are not isolated from each other; instead, they interact in complex ways to influence the dynamics of cattle expansion and associated land use outcomes. This article also discusses the complexities underlying any policy responses that aim to reduce environmental impacts of cattle ranching without hindering regional development and harming the well-being of the rural poor. This article adopts a three-step methodology that begins by formulating an analytical framework based on literature review and interview data to understand the factors shaping the development of cattle ranching, then it uses secondary data to depict the primary trends of production and trade in the cattle sector and, finally, the previous analysis is linked with observed deforestation trends.","[Pacheco, Pablo] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Gede 16115, Bogor Barat, Indonesia",,"Pacheco, P (corresponding author), Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Jalan CIFOR Situ, Gede 16115, Bogor Barat, Indonesia.",p.pacheco@cgiar.org; poccard@cirad.fr,,,,,,,45,46,,,,,,,,,,,,2012.0,102.0,6,,,,1366.0,1390,,10.1080/00045608.2012.678040,,,,,,,,WOS:000309602900008,

The NASA-CASA (Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach) model estimates of annual forest production were used for the first time as the basis to generate a prediction for the standing pool of carbon in above-ground biomass (AGB; gC m(-2)) for forested areas of the Brazilian Amazon region. Plot-level measurements of the residence time of carbon in wood in Amazon forest from Malhi et al. (2006) were interpolated by inverse distance weighting algorithms and used with CASA to generate a new regional map of AGB. Data from the Brazilian PRODES (Estimativa do Desflorestamento da Amazonia) project were used to map deforested areas. Results show that net primary production (NPP) sinks for carbon varied between 4.25 Pg C yr(-1) (1 Pg=10(15) g) and 4.34 Pg C for the region and were highest across the eastern and northern Amazon areas, whereas deforestation sources of CO2 flux from decomposition of residual woody debris were higher and less seasonal in the central Amazon than in the eastern and southern areas. Increased woody debris from past deforestation events was predicted to alter the net ecosystem carbon balance of the Amazon region to generate annual CO2 source fluxes at least two times higher than previously predicted by CASA modeling studies. Variations in climate, land cover, and forest burning were predicted to release carbon at rates of 0.5 to 1 PgC yr(-1) from the Brazilian Amazon. When direct deforestation emissions of CO2 from forest burning of between 0.2 and 0.6 Pg C yr(-1) in the Legal Amazon are overlooked in regional budgets, the year-to-year variations in this net biome flux may appear to be large, whereas our model results implies net biome fluxes had actually been relatively consistent from year to year during the period 2000-2002.

However, this characterization is largely based on agronomic study of tropical soils, and does not fully capture the long-term agricultural potential of cleared land. Landowners can make investments to improve fertility and raise productivity, extending the time horizons over which agriculture is profitable. Whether they choose to make these investments depends on available technologies, the relative prices of inputs and outputs, and the cost of the alternative strategy of clearing additional forest. There is little evidence on how agricultural productivity in the tropics changes over time for individual farmers, because regional development processes confound changes in land productivity when aggregate data are used. Understanding the trajectory of returns to land after tropical deforestation matters because the effectiveness of policies to limit deforestation, promote reforestation, and encourage agricultural intensification all depend on the values of forested and deforested land to farmers and the time horizons over which those values are maintained. This paper estimates the contributions of forested, newly-deforested, and long-deforested land to total property values reported by smallholders in established agrarian settlements in the western Brazilian Amazon. We find-during a decade in which the Brazilian government significantly strengthened its enforcement of forest laws-that deforested land retained its value, the value of forested land increased relative to cleared land, and the value of newly cleared land declined.","[Mullan, Katrina] Univ Montana, Dept Econ, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill L.] Salisbury Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill L.] Salisbury Univ, Environm Studies Dept, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Sills, Erin O.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,"Mullan, K (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Econ, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",katrina.mullan@umontana.edu; jlcaviglia-harris@salisbury.edu; sills@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021.0,108.0,,,,,,,105660,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105660,,AUG 2021,,,,,,WOS:000688430200004,

As for any unfunded mandate, the responses to blacklisting depend on both local incentives and local capacities. We evaluate a state program - Programa Municipios Verdes (PMV) or the Green Municipality Program - to increase the capacity of municipal governments in the state of Para to respond to this federal incentive. The PMV is voluntary, as municipal governments choose whether to participate. To control for differences due to self-selection into the program, we employ quasi-experimental methods: two-way, fixed-effects regressions in matched samples of municipalities; and the synthetic control method that compares outcomes in a participating municipality to outcomes in a weighted blend of control municipalities. Neither approach suggests that the PMV reduced deforestation beyond the effect of the blacklist. We hypothesize that municipalities joined the PMV to ameliorate the costs of complying with blacklist requirements, including the costs of exiting the blacklist. We show that the PMV increased total value added - with substantial heterogeneity - in participating blacklisted municipalities, and that these gains likely are not due to agricultural intensification. They may result from reductions in compliance risk and cost that make economic investments in a municipality more appealing.

However, the prognosis for the socioeconomic wellbeing of inhabitants remains unclear. In an empirical regularity that has been termed the boom bust pattern or the resource curse, the exploitation of natural resources is associated with short-run gains in welfare that dissipate over time. This coupling hypothesis asserts that deforestation and development are correlated such that deforestation leads to only short-term advances in economic welfare that are not sustained once natural forests (along with their mature timber and soil inputs) are exhausted. In contrast, the decoupling hypothesis asserts that deforestation and development need not be correlated over time. In this context, growth that is initially based on deforestation may be sustained and translated into prolonged welfare gains, even once the forest is exhausted. Using census and deforestation data from 1991, 2000 and 2010 for municipalities (i.e., counties) in the Amazon region we confirm that this boom bust pattern appears in cross-sectional data. However, using panel data we show that socioeconomic welfare has become decoupled from environmental factors and is converging to rising national averages. Our findings contradict the conventional wisdom that the exploitation of tropical forests is required to promote Amazonian development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While large spatial variability is observed, the results show coherent relationships between negative dry-season rainfall trends and old-age deforested areas. Deforestation aged up to a decade enhanced rainfall and older deforested regions have reduced rainfall during the dry season.

Simple and multiple regression analyses showed that the strong relationship between fish consumption and Hg exposure was significantly modified by fruit consumption: for the same number of fish meals, those who ate more tropical fruits had lower hair mercury levels. The findings of this study indicate different ways of maintaining fish consumption while reducing Hg exposure in the Amazon. A number of phytochemicals and nutritional fibers present in fruits might be interacting with Hg in several ways: absorption and excretion, transport, binding to target proteins, metabolism, and sequestration.

We do not find any evidence for the turnover hypothesis, perhaps due to the favorable biophysical and market conditions in our study region.

The continuation of this deforestation slowdown in an environment of economic recovery and expansion after 2009 suggests that regulatory enforcement achieved a measure of success not experienced before. In this study, the impact of fines, embargoes on rural private properties, and confiscation of means of production and produce on deforestation in the Southern Amazon state of Mato Grosso was considered through regression and GIS-based analyses. It was found that while all three sanctions were negatively correlated with deforestation, there were important differences in their level of enforcement. Embargoes were effectively implemented and showed high deforestation deterrence effectiveness, but the actual collection of the values of fines issued was extremely low, which casts doubts on their actual effectiveness as a deforestation deterrence mechanism. The results suggest that while sanctions for illegal deforestation have played an important role in the slowdown in deforestation, measures to increase the collection of fines issued are urgently needed.","[Sousa, Paulo Queiroz] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Sendai, Miyagi 9800845, Japan",,"Sousa, PQ (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Sendai, Miyagi 9800845, Japan.",paulobrazoka@hotmail.com,,,,,,,7,8,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2016.0,7.0,3,,,,,,,10.3390/f7030066,,,,,,,,WOS:000373700800014,

The national rural electrification initiative has provided electricity services to more than 14 million people since 2003, mainly through grid extension. However, the initiative has not been able to reach remote areas in the Amazon, thus requiring a review of conditions for small scale off-grid power generation projects. As a result, new rules established under the national rural electrification program address the design and implementation of off-grid power generation projects with an installed capacity up to 100 kW. The objective of this paper is to explore the effects of the new set of rules on the levelized cost of electricity for different power generation solutions in the Amazon. Our study shows that the new rules may be beneficial to isolated communities, as they reduce the levelized cost of electricity, favor renewable energy technologies and may contribute to reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, the new rules may help engage new actors to provide rural electrification of the Amazon region. To fully take advantage of the current scheme, action at local level is required to define the most appropriate model for small-scale power generation projects and establish synergies between concessionaires and local energy providers.

Satellite images allow for distinctions between primary (old-growth) and secondary (successional) forests, but the data indicate more successional forests than expected. We argue that biophysical impediments (e.g., poor soils) and social obstacles (e. g., capital scarcity) led to limited land settlement, low incomes, urbanization, and a shift from crops to pasture, resulting in the rapid expansion of secondary forests without primary forest depletion.

Twelve and a half million hectares, more than 2.5% of the Brazilian Amazon, have been registered under this program. The establishment of property rights may increase a farmer's incentive to invest in his land and expand his farm due to a lower risk of expropriation. On the other hand, the enforcement of conservation requirements may be easier when farmers have legal titles to their land. We use county level data from 2007 to 2012 on farm registrations, deforestation, crop choice and bovine management to test the impact of the Terra Legal land reform. While we find no overall impact of the program on deforestation during the period in our sample, we do show that there is substantial heterogeneity in impacts across counties. Counties with the largest area registered do have an increase in the level of area deforested, but they also have a decrease in the rate of deforestation. We investigate the extent to which changes in deforestation are related to the amount of registration that occurs among small, medium and large farms, and find limited support for less deforestation among counties with more area registered by small farms; more area registered by large farms is associated with a higher level of deforestation, but a decreased deforestation rate. Our results suggest that land tenure reform can create incentives to decelerate deforestation. Farm size has a strong impact on the farm management changes generated by improved property rights; coupling land tenure reforms with incentives to intensify production rather than expand could lead to reduced deforestation, particularly among small farms.

Consequent changes to low-level wind circulation would enhance moisture flux convergence and convection over the newly deforested areas, leading to enhanced rainfall in those areas. However, deforestation of protected areas would decrease dry season rainfall up to 30% in the existing agricultural region, with potentially important negative impacts on agricultural production.

One environmental impact that has raised serious concerns is loss of Amazonian forest through indirect land use change (ILUC), whereby mechanized agriculture encroaches on existing pastures, displacing them to the frontier. This phenomenon has been hypothesized by many researchers and projected on the basis of simulation for the Amazonian forests of Brazil. It has not yet been measured statistically, owing to conceptual difficulties in linking distal land cover drivers to the point of impact. The present article overcomes this impasse with a spatial regression model capable of linking the expansion of mechanized agriculture in settled agricultural areas to pasture conversions on distant, forest frontiers. In an application for a recent period (2003-2008), the model demonstrates that ILUC is significant and of considerable magnitude. Specifically, a 10% reduction of soy in old pasture areas would have decreased deforestation by as much as 40% in heavily forested counties of the Brazilian Amazon. Evidently, the voluntary moratorium on primary forest conversions by Brazilian soy farmers has failed to stop the deforestation effects of expanding soy production. Thus, environmental policy in Brazil must pay attention to ILUC, which can complicate efforts to achieve its REDD targets.","[Arima, Eugenio Y.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geog & Environm, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Richards, Peter; Walker, Robert] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Caldas, Marcellus M.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",,"Arima, EY (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geog & Environm, GRG 334,Mailcode A3100, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",arima@austin.utexas.edu,,,,,,,211,214,,,,,,,,,,,APR-JUN,2011.0,6.0,2,,,,,,24010,10.1088/1748-9326/6/2/024010,,,,,,,,WOS:000295326800010,

Field experiments were conducted at two locations in the Northeast of Para from 2003 to 2008, one in the county of Terra Alta and the other in Tracuateua. An unlimed control and limed treatments were distributed in a randomized complete block design for both experiments. Ten lime rates between 0.1 and 2 M g ha(-1) were assessed in Terra Alta and four lime rates between 1 and 4 M g ha(-1) in Tracuateua. Two varieties of each corn and cowpea in an annual rotation were evaluated in the subplots. Four corn crops (2003-2006) in rotation with three cowpea crops (2004-2006) were evaluated in Terra Alta. Maximum corn grain yields were achieved in Terra Alta with applications of 1 M g ha(-1) of lime whereas maximum cowpea yields required lower lime rates. In Tracuateua, cowpea yield response to lime applied in 2003 was first observed in the 2005 harvest, with a maximum yield obtained with the residual lime rate of 1 M g ha(-1), with significant differences between varieties. Yield responses of both crops to lime were associated with increased soil Ca + Mg levels and reduced Al saturation. Trends in declining soil Ca + Mg and increasing Al saturation with time after liming were observed at both sites, but were more pronounced in Tracuateua. Corn planted in 2007 and 2008 in Tracuateua provided linear yield responses to rates of up to 4 M g ha(-1) of lime. Collective data from both sites indicated that the appropriate lime rate for corn in these soils should reduce Al saturation to less than 11 %. The importance of varietal selection with cowpea was illustrated by the difference in Al saturation tolerance, which ranged between 13 and 32 % among the varieties evaluated.","[Smyth, Thomas Jot] Univ Estadual Carolina N, Dept Ciencia Solo, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,,mscravo@gmail.com; jot_smyth@ncsu.edu; brasil@cpatu.embrapa.br,,,,,,,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,MAY-JUN,2012.0,36.0,3,,,,895.0,907,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000306974300020,

We find that diversification of agricultural cash crops is negatively correlated with forest clearing by colonists, providing limited evidence for the hypothesis. Other significant covariates of diversification and forest clearing include cash income levels, stage in family life cycle, cattle ownership, and chemical inputs.

The case of the Brazilian Amazon has wider relevance: it sheds light on the limits and possibilities of international environmental cooperation, and shows how an international coalition against deforestation emerged.

However, methods used to classify successional stages are limited. This research explores a method that can be used to differentiate regrowth stages. The vegetation inventory data were collected in Altamira, Bragantina, Pedras, and Tome-Acu of the eastern Amazon basin. A nested sampling strategy, organized by region, site, plot, and subplot, was employed for field data collection. Above-ground biomass (AGB). forest stand volume (FSV), basal area, average stand height, average stand diameter (ASD), age, ratio of tree biomass to total biomass (RTB), ratio of tree volume to total volume, and ratio of tree basal area to total basal area were calculated at the site level. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was used to differentiate successional stages and to identify the best forest stand parameters to distinguish these stages. This research indicates that the CDA approach can be used to classify successional forest stages, but using RTB or a combination of two stand parameters such as AGB and ASD are more feasible and recommended in practice.

Using satellite data, we test the effect of property rights on deforestation between 1982 and 2016. In order to identify causal effects, we combine a regression discontinuity design with the orthogonal timing of homologation. We find that observations inside territories with full property rights show a significant decrease in deforestation, while the effect does not exist in territories without full property rights. While these are local average treatment effects, our results suggest that not only do indigenous territories serve a human-rights role, but they are a cost-effective way for governments to preserve their forested areas. First, obtaining full property rights is crucial to recognize indigenous peoples' original right to land and protect their territories from illegal deforestation. Second, when implemented, indigenous property rights reduce deforestation inside indigenous territories in the Amazon rainforest, and could provide an important positive externality for Brazil and the rest of the world in terms of climate change mitigation.","[Baragwanath, Kathryn] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bayi, Ella] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",,"Baragwanath, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kbaragwa@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 25,2020.0,117.0,34,,,,20495.0,20502,,10.1073/pnas.1917874117,,,,,,,,WOS:000572349000028,

Evidence from across the Brazilian Amazon,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Protected areas (PAs) are a widely used strategy for conserving forests and ecosystem services. When PAs succeed in deterring economic activities that degrade forests, the impacts include more forest yet less economic gain. These economic opportunity costs of conservation lead actors with economic interests to resist new PAs, driving their sites away from profitable market centers and towards areas featuring lower opportunity costs. Further, after PAs are created, economic actors may want PA downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (collectively PADDD). We examine reductions in PAs' spatial extent - downsizings (partial erasures) and degazettements (complete erasures) - that presumably reduce protection. Using data for the entire Brazilian Amazon from PADDDtracker.org, our empirical analyses explore whether size reductions from 2006 to 2015 resulted from bargaining between development and conservation. We find that the risks of PA size reductions are raised by: lower travel costs (as implied by distances to roads and cities), which affect economic gains and enforcement; greater PA size, which affects enforcement; and more prior internal deforestation, which lowers the impacts of size reductions. These dynamics of protection offer insights on the potentially conflicting factors that lead to PA size reductions, with implications for policymaking to enhance PA effectiveness and permanence.","[Keles, Derya; Delacote, Philippe] Univ Lorraine, Univ Strasbourg, Bur Econ Theor & Appl BETA, INRAE,AgroParisTech,CNRS, Nancy, France; [Delacote, Philippe] Climate Econ Chair, Paris, France; [Pfaff, Alexander] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC USA; [Qin, Siyu] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Qin, Siyu; Mascia, Michael B.] Conservat Int, Moore Ctr Sci, Arlington, VA USA",,"Keles, D (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, Univ Strasbourg, Bur Econ Theor & Appl BETA, INRAE,AgroParisTech,CNRS, Nancy, France.",derya.keles@inrae.fr; philippe.delacote@inrae.fr; alex.pfaff@duke.edu; qinsiyu@geo.hu-berlin.de; mmascia@conservation.org,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2020.0,176.0,,,,,,,106733,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106733,,,,,,,,WOS:000556782100020,

Dynamics of biomass, C, and nutrient pools in regenerating forests",OECOLOGIA,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Regenerating forests have become a common land-cover type throughout the Brazilian Amazon. However, the potential for these systems to accumulate and store C and nutrients, and the fluxes resulting from them when they are cut, burned, and converted back to croplands and pastures have not been well quantified. In this study, we quantified pre- and post-fire pools of biomass, C, and nutrients, as well as the emissions of those elements, at a series of second- and third-growth forests located in the states of Para and Rondonia, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) of second- and third-growth forests averaged 134 and 91 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Rates of aboveground biomass accumulation were rapid in these systems, but were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, ranging from 9 to 16 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Residual pools of biomass originating from primary forest vegetation accounted for large portions of TAGB in both forest types and were primarily responsible for TAGB differences between the two forest types. In second-growth forests this pool (82 Mg ha(-1)) represented 58% of TAGB, and in third-growth forests (40 Mg ha(-1)) it represented 40% of TAGB. Amounts of TAGB consumed by burning of second- and third-growth forests averaged 70 and 53 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Aboveground pre-fire pools in second- and third-growth forests averaged 67 and 45 Mg C ha(-1), 821 and 707 kg N ha(-1), 441 and 341 kg P ha(-1), and 46 and 27 kg Ca ha(-1), respectively. While pre-fire pools of C, N, S and K were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, pools of both P and Ca were significantly higher in second-growth forests. This suggests that increasing land use has a negative impact on these elemental pools. Site losses of elements resulting from slashing and burning these sites were highly variable: losses of C ranged from 20 to 47 Mg ha(-1); N losses ranged from 306 to 709 kg ha(-1); Ca losses ranged from 10 to 145 kg ha(-1); and P losses ranged from 2 to 20 kg ha(-1). Elemental losses were controlled to a large extent by the relative distribution of elemental mass within biomass components of varying susceptibilities to combustion and the temperatures of volatilization of each element. Due to a relatively low temperature of volatilization and its concentration in highly combustible biomass pools, site losses of N averaged 70% of total pre-fire pools. In contrast, site losses of P and Ca resulting from burning were 33 and 20% of total pre-fire pools, respectively, as much of the mass of those elements was deposited on site as ash. Pre- and post-fire biomass and elemental pools of second- and third-growth forests, as well as the emissions from those systems, were intermediate between those of primary forests and pastures in the Brazilian Amazon. Overall, regenerating forests have the capacity to act as either large terrestrial sinks or sources of C and nutrients, depending on the course of land-use patterns within the Brazilian Amazon. Combining remote sensing techniques with field measures of aboveground C accumulation in regenerating forests and C fluxes from those forests when they are cut and burned, we estimate that during 1990-1991 roughly 104 Tg of C was accumulated by regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon. Further, we estimate that approximately 103 Tg of C was lost via the cutting and burning of regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon during this same period. Since average C accumulations (5. 5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) in regenerating forests were 19% of the C lost when such forests are cut and burned (29.3 Mg ha(-1)), our results suggest that when less than 19% of the total area accounted for by secondary forests is cut and burned in a given year, those forests will be net accumulators of C during that year. Conversely, when more than 19% of regenerating forests are burned, those forests will be a net source of C to the atmosphere.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,"Hughes, RF (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Campus Box 216, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,,51,53,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2000.0,124.0,4,,,,574.0,588,,10.1007/s004420000416,,,,,,,,WOS:000089509700012,

Monitoring and assessing spatial and temporal fire dynamics have a fundamental relevance in the understanding of ecological processes and the human impacts on different landscapes and multiple spatial scales. This work analyzes the spatio-temporal distribution of burned areas in one of the biggest savanna vegetation enclaves in the southern Brazilian Amazon, from 2000 to 2016, deriving information from multiple remote sensing data sources (Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance, TRMM pluviometry and Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers). A fire scars database with 30m spatial resolution was generated using a Landsat time series. MODIS daily surface reflectance was used for accurate dating of the fire scars. TRMM pluviometry data were analyzed to dynamically establish time limits of the yearly dry season and burning periods. Burned area extent, frequency and recurrence were quantified comparing the results annually/seasonally. Additionally, Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers were used to analyze fire incidence over different types of tree cover domains. In the last seventeen years, 1.03 million ha were burned within the study area, distributed across 1432 fire occurrences, highlighting 2005, 2010 and 2014 as the most affected years. Middle dry season fires represent 86.21% of the total burned areas and 32.05% of fire occurrences, affecting larger amount of higher density tree surfaces than other burning periods. The results provide new insights into the analysis of burned areas of the neotropical savannas, spatially and statistically reinforcing important aspects linked to the seasonality patterns of fire incidence in this landscape.

Since then, however, deforestation has slowly increased again, casting doubts on the long-term sustainability of past conservation policy achievements. Clearly, deforestation rates and the associated local drivers of land-use and land-cover change differ considerably across the region, and adapting public policies to dynamic local contexts and actor constellations remains a major challenge for decision-makers. This paper seeks to contribute to the related science-policy debate by applying frontier theory insights to map, quantify, and compare land-cover dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004 and 2015. Our theoretical framework performs well in explaining broad variations in scope, nature, and agents of land-use and land-cover change across different frontier regions. We observe two types of transformative processes at deforestation frontiers in the Amazonian context. First, recent frontier development is characterized by an intensification of cattle ranching, and an increasing share of agricultural activities in the production portfolio, which could be the result of better access to modern technologies and markets, combined with forest governance induced scarcity of land for expansion of historically dominant extensive pasture systems. Second, the share of medium and large-scale deforestation declines at first, but rebounds during the observation period in all frontier types after 2012. Further research is needed to better understand the role of the changing political environment in driving these medium and short-term transformations in land-use and land-cover change. Furthermore, policy-makers, international cooperation, and civil society must seek strong integration between value chain based governance measures and effective environmental law enforcement.","[Schielein, Johannes; Boerner, Jan] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Boerner, Jan] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Nussallee, Germany",,"Schielein, J (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",johannes.schielein@uni-bonn.de; jborner@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,54,56,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2018.0,76.0,,,,,81.0,94,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.04.052,,,,,,,,WOS:000435619900009,

Using a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic numerical model (MOBEEHDYCS), and realistic bathymetry and coastline of the northern Brazilian shelf, this paper aims at studying the influence of some specific physical processes on the morphology of the Amazon plume. The very large volume discharge (180000m(3)/s on average) and the weak effect of Coriolis force are additional characteristics of the studied system, which induce a particular dynamics. The various forcing factors are successively introduced into the model in order to simulate and to determine their respective influences upon the plume extent and the hydrodynamics at the shelf scale. Simulation reveal that the coastal current is at the origin of the permanent northwestward Amazon Plume extension while wind effect can either reinforce or moderate this situation. The tide intervenes also to modify the position of the salinity front: a horizontal migration of salinity front is observed under its action. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted 184 km of line-transect censuses over a period of 3 me, and found that although primary and secondary forests held a similar abundance of large vertebrates, the species composition was very different. Secondary forests supported a high abundance of ungulate browsers (0.8 5 vs 0.44 indiv. per 10 km) and smaller-bodied primates (15.6 vs 4.6 indiv. per 10 km) compared with primary forests. However, large prehensile-tailed primates were absent (black spider monkey Ateles paniscus) or at very low abundance (Guyanan red howler monkey Alouatta macconelli) in secondary forest. The abundance of large frugivorous/granivorous birds was also low in secondary forests compared with primary forests (22.6 vs 37.1 individuals per 10 km, respectively). Faunal assemblages appear to reflect food resource availability. Concurrent vegetation surveys indicated that secondary forests had high levels of terrestrial and understorey browse. Fruit production was largely restricted to pioneer trees such as Bellucia and Inga spp. Although these regenerating forests were an important habitat for large mammals and birds, they were limited in terms of faunal richness, particularly dispersers of large-seeded plants.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",,"Parry, L (corresponding author), EMBRAPA, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Trav Dr Eneas Pinheiro, S-N, Belem, Para, Brazil.",l.parry@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,67,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2007.0,23.0,,6,,,653.0,662,,10.1017/S0266467407004506,,,,,,,,WOS:000251342000005,

Two competing harvest management strategies have been proposed: Land sharing via low-intensity logging throughout a concession; and high-intensity land-sparing logging across a smaller area, protecting part of the concession as primary forest. Empirical research points to land sparing being more optimal for maintaining biodiversity and carbon, especially under secure land tenure, but a key question for forest-based economies is how each strategy affects the profitability of logging. We combine detailed financial data with harvest simulations to assess the profitability of land-sharing and land-sparing logging in the Brazilian Amazon. Under business-as-usual, land-sharing is significantly more profitable than land-sparing logging, whether sparing is conducted in a single block or targeting the highest-density timber stocks, highlighting a conflict between economic and conservation priorities. Land-sharing logging is also more profitable than hybrid strategies whereby a mix of land-sharing and land-sparing logging is employed. Conservation-based restrictions that apply quotas on species in different size classes reduces the opportunity cost of land sparing, but even under tight restrictions land sharing remains more profitable and land sparing often returns a loss. Additional financial incentives, including timber certification schemes and carbon-based payment for ecosystem services, are needed to bridge the opportunity cost of land-sparing logging and minimise ecological damage to tropical rainforests.","[Bousfield, Christopher G.; Massam, Mike R.; Acosta, Ileana A.; Edwards, David P.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Biosci, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Peres, Carlos A.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",,"Bousfield, CG; Edwards, DP (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Biosci, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",cbousfield1@sheffield.ac.uk; david.edwards@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021.0,16.0,11,,,,,,114002,10.1088/1748-9326/ac2b5f,,,,,,,,WOS:000707213000001,

Evidence from two isolated villages of the Brazilian Amazon",ENERGY AND BUILDINGS,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Since the launch of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative in 2011, renewable off-grid energy systems have attracted increasing attention as means to break the vicious circle of poverty and improving living conditions in rural areas of developing countries. The extensive diffusion of decentralised renewable energy technologies, while harvesting international positive reactions, is scarcely understood in the context of livelihood strategies and micro-level analysis of remote villages located in protected areas of the Amazon forest. The scope of this paper is to explore the impacts of energy use in two decentralised systems, from renewable and non-renewable sources, on livelihood diversification in the Brazilian Amazon. Empirical research gathering qualitative and quantitative data was conducted in two isolated sites in the state of Amazonas. To understand the multidimensional factors influencing poverty reduction and income generation in relation to renewable and non-renewable energy use on livelihoods, this study used the Sustainable Livelihood Framework as conceptual framework. The main findings of this research show that while energy from solar PV mini-grid encourages the productivity of existing home-based off-farm income, the system does not meet future demand for either new income generating activities, demographic growth or migration.

Methods: Utilizing 2004-2008 malaria incidence data collected from six Brazilian Amazon states, large-scale spatial patterns of malaria risk were characterized with a novel Bayesian multi-pathogen geospatial model. Data included 2.4 million malaria cases spread across 3.6 million sq km. Remotely sensed variables (deforestation rate, forest cover, rainfall, dry season length, and proximity to large water bodies), socio-economic variables (rural population size, income, and literacy rate, mortality rate for children age under five, and migration patterns), and GIS variables (proximity to roads, hydro-electric dams and gold mining operations) were incorporated as covariates. Results : Borrowing information across pathogens allowed for better spatial predictions of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, as evidenced by a ten-fold cross-validation. Malaria incidence for both Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum tended to be higher in areas with greater forest cover. Proximity to gold mining operations was another important risk factor, corroborated by a positive association between migration rates and malaria incidence. Finally, areas with a longer dry season and areas with higher average rural income tended to have higher malaria risk. Risk maps reveal striking spatial heterogeneity in malaria risk across the region, yet these mean disease risk surface maps can be misleading if uncertainty is ignored. By combining mean spatial predictions with their associated uncertainty, several sites were consistently classified as hotspots, suggesting their importance as priority areas for malaria prevention and control. Conclusion: This article provides several contributions. From a methodological perspective, the benefits of jointly modelling multiple pathogens for spatial predictions were illustrated. In addition, maps of mean disease risk were contrasted with that of statistically significant disease clusters, highlighting the critical importance of uncertainty in determining disease hotspots. From an epidemiological perspective, forest cover and proximity to gold mining operations were important large-scale drivers of disease risk in the region. Finally, the hotspot in Western Acre was identified as the area that should receive highest priority from the Brazilian national malaria prevention and control programme.","[Valle, Denis; Lima, Joanna M.

Using a precipitationshed moisture tracking framework, we quantify the contribution sources of evaporation to rainfall in Rondonia in the Brazilian Amazon. Forests account for similar to 48% of annual rainfall on average, and more than half of the forest source is from protected areas (PAs). During droughts in 2005 and 2010, moisture supply decreased from oceans and nonforested areas, while supply from forests was stable and compensated for the decrease. Remote sensing and land surface models corroborate the relative insensitivity of forest evapotranspiration to droughts.

This threat affects the ability of companies to manage viable forest production and distorts the way in which governments are able to implement forest management regulations at all levels. However, quantitative information about the direct impacts of illegal logging is scarce. We evaluate some of the most relevant impacts of illegal logging to government and society in the Bolivian, Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon. The impacts evaluated are loss of government royalties, missed appropriation of revenues, inefficiency in logging operations, loss of productivity and unemployment. The direct costs of illegal logging in the three countries are estimated at between US$558 to 639 million per year. Unemployment due to Illegal logging, defined as the difference between the employment required for legal and illegal logging, is estimated at 1.2 million person-days per year. The magnitude of these impacts justifies additional investment in control and monitoring mechanisms.

This article examines the production of the French explorateur and geographer Octavie Coudreau through analysis of the natural history/travel narrative, Voyage au Trombetas (1899), and her subsequent narrative Voyage au Cumina (1901). Octavie Coudreau initially went to Amazonia to travel with her husband, Henri Coudreau, already a renowned explorer of the French and Brazilian Amazon. After Henri Coudreau's death on their first voyage, Octavie Coudreau continued working under contract for the Brazilian state and published natural history narratives after each of her four exploratory and mapping missions. These travel narratives include suggestions for increased colonization along with observation of local populaces, supported by a multitude of maps and photographs. Using feminist approaches to the historiography of travel, empire, and geographical work, I look at the female European explorer's view of imperialism during this significant period in Amazonian history and development. I examine the unfixing of gender identity as it relates to movement within a liminal space. I think of this as the in-between place in which Octavie finds herself - as a grieving widow, thrust into a position of power abroad, while still dealing with the limitations of her gender during this time period, and the space of the Amazon itself, a region in flux where multiple races and imperial powers interact in a contact zone.","[Carey-Webb, Jessica] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Spanish & Portuguese, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Carey-Webb, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Spanish & Portuguese, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",jesscw@utexas.edu,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,24.0,4,,,,465.0,481,,10.1080/0966369X.2017.1335288,,,,,,,,WOS:000405295300001,

This paper takes up the case of the Amazon to address two questions concerning the adoption of agricultural technologies: 1) what are its social determinants, and 2) what are its land use correlates. Empirical data come from a recent survey of smallholders along the Transamazon highway. The first part of the analysis, consisting of models of eight agricultural technologies, shows that households with more labor and capital are more likely to adopt technologies. The second part shows that for all technologies, adopters have more land cleared than do non-adopters.

The relationships between surface concentration and the mean suspended sediment concentration in the gauging section cross section derived from HyBAm field measurements were used to estimate the mean sediment concentration in the cross-section. Combination of these data with the discharge record made it possible to calculate the sediment loads and the specific sediment yields for these stations. The specific sediment yields ranged from 10 to 560 t km(-2) year(-1) and evidence significant spatial contrasts between the upstream areas, draining mountainous areas (white water), and the downstream Amazonian flood plain areas (black and clear water). Upstream-downstream suspended sediment budgets for the major tributaries (six stations) were used to identify zones of sediment transfer, erosion and deposition. Important sediment deposition zones were identified along the Amazon River. Thus, about 20% of the suspended sediment yield from the Negro/Solimoes/Madeira rivers was deposited upstream of Obidos, the lowest operational gauging station on the Amazon River.

Spatial-temporal dynamics of aboveground biomass (AGB) and forest area affect the carbon cycle, climate and biodiversity in the Brazilian Amazon. Here we investigate interannual changes in AGB and forest area by analysing satellite-based annual AGB and forest area datasets. We found that the gross forest area loss was larger in 2019 than in 2015, possibly due to recent loosening of forest protection policies. However, the net AGB loss was three times smaller in 2019 than in 2015. During 2010-2019, the Brazilian Amazon had a cumulative gross loss of 4.45 Pg C against a gross gain of 3.78 Pg C, resulting in a net AGB loss of 0.67 Pg C. Forest degradation (73%) contributed three times more to the gross AGB loss than deforestation (27%), given that the areal extent of degradation exceeds that of deforestation. This indicates that forest degradation has become the largest process driving carbon loss and should become a higher policy priority.","[Qin, Yuanwei; Xiao, Xiangming; Wu, Xiaocui; Doughty, Russell] Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Earth Observat & Modeling, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Wigneron, Jean-Pierre; Li, Xiaojun] INRA Nouvelle Aquitaine, UMR 1391, ISPA, Bordeaux Villenave Dorno, France; [Ciais, Philippe] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Brandt, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fan, Lei] Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observat &, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Crowell, Sean; Moore, Berrien] Univ Oklahoma, Coll Atmospher & Geog Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Doughty, Russell] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Zhang, Yao] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA USA; [Liu, Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England",,"Xiao, XM (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Earth Observat & Modeling, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.; Wigneron, JP (corresponding author), INRA Nouvelle Aquitaine, UMR 1391, ISPA, Bordeaux Villenave Dorno, France.",xiangming.xiao@ou.edu; jean-pierre.wigneron@inrae.fr,,,,,,,35,36,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021.0,11.0,5,,,,442.0,+,,10.1038/s41558-021-01026-5,,APR 2021,,,,,,WOS:000645495200003,

In this paper we add to the existing literature on evaluating the Brazilian anti-deforestation policies by specifically quantifying the impact of blacklisting on deforestation. We first use spatial matching techniques using a set of covariates that includes official blacklisting criteria to identify control districts. We then explore the effect of blacklisting on change in deforestation in double difference regressions with panel data covering the period from 2002 to 2012. Multiple robustness checks are conducted including an analysis of potential causal mechanisms behind the success of the blacklist.

Ethnographic data from one village suggests that current community relationships are part of a multilayered political and social landscape. Now, village ties are forged and maintained because of ramped-up transportation and communication within the territory, bureaucratic structures that demand consistent intervillage diplomacy, economic incentives that offer Kayapo communities opportunities for engagement and competition, and ongoing alliances to protect and defend the integrity of the Kayapo lands and their territorial boundaries.","Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,"Zanotti, L (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2011.0,34.0,2,,,,290.0,314,,10.1111/j.1555-2934.2011.01167.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000309885600006,

Given the biodiversity and climate change consequences of the disappearance of this forest, it is pivotal to understand these farmers' reactions to combinations of technologies, policies, and institutional arrangements to predict their deforestation implications. This study aims to find whether settlement farmers in the western Brazilian Amazon will adopt more intensive production systems, and if they do, what the impact of this adoption would be on deforestation and farm incomes. Adoption of four types of intensification and their economic and environmental impacts were predicted using a farm level bioeconomic linear programming model. The four intensification types were: no intensification, intensification of non-livestock activities on cleared land, intensification on all cleared land, and intensification on both cleared and forested land. Intensified land uses on either the cleared or forested lands generate higher returns to labor and land, and thus will likely be adopted by settlement farmers. Also, intensification of non-livestock activities on cleared land resulted in the largest deforestation rates. Despite its lower deforestation rate, intensification on all cleared land (including pasture) resulted in the least amount of preserved forest after 25 years. More precisely it decimated the forest. Intensification on forested land - low-impact forest management - slowed the deforestation rate, but did not stop it unless timber prices were increased to R$550 m(-3) (a R$335 increase over 1994 prices). Even with intensified activities on forested land, pasture still dominated the landscape, In the long run, there is a trade-off between farm income and forest preserved, which results from intensification of land uses on the cleared land. Under the current socioeconomic and political setting existing intensification systems on the cleared land will not save the forest. Intensification systems on forested lands provide better hope because they increase the value of the standing forest, thus counteracting the pressure to deforest. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This is especially the case in developing nations, which are high in natural resources, where road development is rapid and often not centrally managed. Characterization of large scale spatio-temporal patterns in road network development has been greatly overlooked to date. This paper examines the spatio-temporal dynamics of road density across the Brazilian Amazon and assesses the relative contributions of local versus neighbourhood effects for temporal changes in road density at regional scales. To achieve this, a combination of statistical analyses and model-data fusion techniques inspired by studies of spatio-temporal dynamics of populations in ecology and epidemiology were used. The emergent development may be approximated by local growth that is logistic through time and directional dispersal. The current rates and dominant direction of development may be inferred, by assuming that roads develop at a rate of 55 km per year. Large areas of the Amazon will be subject to extensive anthropogenic change should the observed patterns of road development continue.","[Ahmed, Sadia E.; Smith, Matthew J.] Microsoft Res, Sci Computat Lab, Computat Ecol & Environm Sci Grp, Cambridge CB1 2FB, England; [Ahmed, Sadia E.; Ewers, Robert M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England",,"Ahmed, SE (corresponding author), Microsoft Res, Sci Computat Lab, Computat Ecol & Environm Sci Grp, 21 Stn Rd, Cambridge CB1 2FB, England.",sadia@microsoft.com,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2014.0,41.0,3,,,,253.0,264,,10.1017/S0376892913000520,,,,,,,,WOS:000340944100004,

Nevertheless, both poverty and landlessness have persisted despite development policies that distributed billions of dollars on highway construction, loans, and outright subsidies. Inequitable land distribution has been held as a prime factor in land conflict across the country. Although episodes of conflict over land are common in Brazilian history, this paper focuses on agrarian issues that arose with the opening of the Amazon frontier in the 1970s. The paper presents a political economy approach that considers the role of hierarchical forces interacting across spatial scales, in creating conditions ripe for land conflict at the local level. The premise is that the Brazilian government, intending to bring about economic and social development, promoted contradictory strategies creating land scarcity. These strategies led to expansion of large ranching operations, creation of conservation units, and demarcation of indigenous reserves, which constrained the pool of land available for small farmer settlement. Empirical analysis employing regression and spatial statistics is used to test the proposed model, advancing previous efforts by applying spatial regression, incorporating improved indicators of conflict and explanatory variables generated by a Geographic Information System (GIS). The findings provide support for some elements of the argument, demonstrating statistically significant relationships between land conflict and land concentration, cattle ranching, and road construction. Finally, a case study analysis of a county in the heart of the land conflict zone is provided, illustrating the interaction of scalar forces, and the articulation of land conflict at the local level.","Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Geog, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",,"Simmons, CS (corresponding author), Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Geog, 276 Dow Sci Bldg, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",simmo1cs@cmich.edu,,,,,,,64,71,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2004.0,94.0,1,,,,183.0,206,,10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.09401010.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000189291300010,

This assumption tends to overlook the economic and ecological consequences of social interactions through which people with diverse forms of rationality gradually produce distinction between state and society and shape environmental governance as an embedded process. This paper presents a case study of spontaneous settlers called posseiros in the south-east of the state of Pars in the Brazilian Amazon and examines ways that their social interactions lead to the so-called emancipation movements for municipal making on the agrarian frontier and open civic places in which environmental governance is negotiated. It pays particular attention to the role of religion, especially the Pentecostal Church of Assembly of God in relation to the traditional Catholic Church, in influencing the posseiros' ecological rationality and the articulation of emancipation movements and argues that the focus on religion sheds new light on the linkage between the environment, livelihoods and local governance.

We evaluated the rainfall products using additional validation gauges (N = 55) at the monthly and seasonal time scales and compared their drought events and temporal trends. Both CHIRP (10.0 mm/month mean error (ME), 23.6% percent bias (PB)) and CHIRPS (-0.08ME, 7.4% PB) underestimate high monthly rainfall in the wet season and overestimate low monthly rainfall during the dry season. dnCHIRPS had a lower error in monthly rainfall (-0.01ME, 1.1%PB) compared with CHIRP and CHIRPS, with the largest percentage difference between dnCHIRPS and the other two datasets in the dry season. dnCHIRPS captured decreasing trends in dry season rainfall over agricultural parts of the state, trends that were missed by the other two products.

The Brazilian Amazon's vast wealth of extractive resources and its large economically depressed population make it the emblematic site for neoextractivism. Its biodiversity and inhabited landscapes, however, mean that the neoextractive program encounters concerted resistance from the global environmental community as well as from traditional, indigenous, and migrant smallholders. In response, neoextractivism must deploy another form of progressivism-environmentalism. The author uses the case of agroindustrial soy production in the Brazilian Amazonian state of Para to demonstrate how the emergence of environmental governance there facilitates neoextractivism by 'greening' it. Through an analysis of the mechanisms and effects of two programs, implemented through partnerships between nongovernmental organizations and corporations, to manage soy expansion into the Amazon, it is demonstrated that these programs have questionable environmental benefits at best and at worst work to reenforce the hegemony of international environmental organizations, to green the image of agri-business multinationals, and to destabilize strategies of resistance.","Duke Univ, Thompson Writing Program, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Baletti, B (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Thompson Writing Program, Art Bldg,Campus Box 90025, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",Brenda.baletti@duke.edu,,,,,,,31,31,,,,,,,,,,,,2014.0,46.0,1,,,,5.0,25,,10.1068/a45241,,,,,,,,WOS:000336258700002,

Despite the broad growing trend of pasture expansion for adoption of cattle ranching as the main land use associated with frontier expansion, some differences persist across actor types. In relative terms, medium- and large-scale landholders place most of their cleared forestland under pasture, and in absolute terms, largeholders have deforested more than smallholders because they hold larger tracts of land. Recently, however, deforestation activity has been increasing in frontiers occupied by smallholders who tend to convert a greater proportion of the forestland in their landholdings to agricultural land uses than larger-scale landholders, mainly to expand cattle ranching operations. Furthermore, smallholders tend to maintain higher cattle stocking rates than medium- and large-scale landholders, which tend to adopt extensive systems of cattle production. Both economic and human development indices in each frontier type vary according to actor type. While in absolute terms, higher per capita agricultural income levels are found in frontiers where largeholders predominate, the corresponding incomes are higher in smallholder frontiers when prorated by unit of land under crops and pasture. In addition, the Human Development Index is higher in frontiers with greater presence of large-scale landholdings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Explicit spatial knowledge on where, when and how pastures are managed and intensification takes place is needed to better estimate potentials of more sustainable management. Monitoring the frequency of management practices like burning of pasture land and tillage treatment with adequate spatial resolution therefore offers novel indicators for describing land use intensity. With dense time series of Landsat data, it appears possible to quantify land use intensity also in heterogeneous landscapes where fine-scale processes cannot be monitored with previously available datasets. Our overarching goal is to describe the occurrence or absence of extensive or intensive management regimes over time. For this study, we focused on detecting fire and tillage events in the region of Novo Progresso, Para, Brazil, where deforested land is mostly used for cattle ranching by both largeholders and smallholders. We used a dense time series of Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 surface reflectance data to mitigate the problem of varying cloud cover. For each acquisition date, we extracted a temporal sequence of three subsequent clear observations at pixel level. The temporal variation in each clear observation sequence was characterized by a stack of spectral and temporal features. These feature stacks were classified with a random forest to identify the management events. We aggregated the classification results based on the random forest class probabilities and derived normalized annual class scores for land management events. The yielded class score maps show burned and tilled areas on a yearly basis and provide a measure of model confidence. We detected burned pastures with area adjusted user accuracies of 80-98%, burned secondary regrowth with 63-80% and tilled pastures with 74-78%. Our approach was able to discriminate management events even when they succeeded very fast. This way, the mapping approach with clear observation sequences allows us to contextualize management events directly from dense time series of high resolution satellite data. This opens new pathways to disentangle how management practices between smallholders and agribusinesses vary in the Brazilian Amazon. With sensor constellations from Sentinel-2 and Landsat data becoming a unified source for much denser time series soon, our method bears great potential to better understand and map pasture dynamics in the Amazon.","[Jakimow, Benjamin; Griffiths, Patrick; van der Linden, Sebastian; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [van der Linden, Sebastian; Hostert, Patrick] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",,"Jakimow, B (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",benjamin.jakimow@geo.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,27,27,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2018.0,205.0,,,,,453.0,468,,10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.009,,,,,,,,WOS:000423007700033,

There are ongoing discussions about whether and how projects should be integrated into national climate change mitigation efforts under the Paris Agreement. One consideration is whether these projects have generated additional impacts over and above national policies and other measures. To help inform these discussions, we compare the crediting baselines established ex-ante by voluntary REDD+ projects in the Brazilian Amazon to counterfactuals constructed ex-post based on the quasi-experimental synthetic control method. We find that the crediting baselines assume consistently higher deforestation than counterfactual forest loss in synthetic control sites. This gap is partially due to decreased deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon during the early implementation phase of the REDD+ projects considered here. This suggests that forest carbon finance must strike a balance between controlling conservation investment risk and ensuring the environmental integrity of carbon emission offsets. Relatedly, our results point to the need to better align project- and national-level carbon accounting.","[West, Thales A.

There, local farmers of Japanese descent have developed a variety of agroforestry systems in which 10 to 20 hectare (ha) fields yield incomes comparable to 400 to 1,200 ha pastures. In addition, such crop fields generate substantially more rural employment per ha than do pastures. Ongoing forest conversion to pasture is clearly not a product of sound economic decision making.

Repeated glacial cycles have dominated Earth's recent climate, but it is unclear whether these rivers are sensitive to such rapid changes. The Amazon River system, the largest and highest-discharge in the world, features extensive young terraces that demonstrate geologically rapid change temporally correlated with changes in runoff from Quaternary climate cycles. To test the plausibility of a causal relationship, we use a simple model to estimate from empirical measurements how quickly a river profile responds to changes in discharge or sediment supply. Applying this model to data from 30 gauging stations along alluvial rivers throughout the Brazilian Amazon, we find that many rivers of the Amazon basin can respond faster than glacially induced changes in runoff or sediment flux. The Amazon basin is unusually responsive compared to other large river systems due to its high discharge and sediment flux, narrow floodplains, and low slopes. As a result, we predict that the Amazon basin has been highly dynamic during Quaternary glacial cycles, with cyclical aggradation and incision of lowland rivers driving repeated habitat and environmental change throughout the region. This dynamic landscape may have contributed to the exceptional biodiversity of the region and patterns of ancient human settlement.","[Goldberg, Samuel L.; Schmidt, Morgan J.; Perron, J.

The results show that most households in the research area use chemicals, which seems to be related to most households engaged in the production of naranjilla, a citrus fruit that requires high amounts of pesticides to prosper in the Amazon. Expenditure on chemicals is principally driven by wealth, access to credit and land use patterns, with households with more land in crops spending more on fertilizers and pesticides. An important finding is that households receiving money from government social programs spend more on both chemical fertilizers and pesticides than non-recipient households. Ethnicity does not play any role in shaping expenditures on both chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

We show that agricultural firms can obtain positive externalities from locating in close proximity to other agricultural firms, leading to agglomeration economies. Agglomeration economies lead to high levels of competition and diversity within a local agricultural supply chain and influence local prices, information flows, and private enforcement of environmental institutions. We use the theory of agglomeration economies to understand the development of soybean production in two counties along the Santarem-Cuiaba (BR-163) highway in the Brazilian Amazon: Santarem, Para and Sorriso, Mato Grosso. We conclude that differences in environmental and land tenure institutions influenced the occurrence of agglomeration economies in these two counties, which in turn affected the total factor productivity of soy in each region. In particular, the supply chain became extremely competitive and diverse in Sorriso where few environmental regulations existed, while environmental restrictions reduced the diversification of the supply chain in Santarem. The presence of a soy agglomeration economy in Sorriso spurred innovation, increased productivity, and led to extremely rapid soy expansion in that county, while the monopolistic supply chain in Santarem reduced producers' access to land and capital and impeded soy expansion.

In a scenario analysis for the nine states of the Brazilian Amazon, we calculate: (i) the expected time for exhaustion of the current forest stock; and (ii) the potential forest coverage for the next 20, 100 and 200 years. Our results suggest that if forest benefits grow over time at a sufficiently high speed, they may significantly slow down deforestation. In contrast, the higher their volatility, the faster deforestation proceeds.","[Di Corato, Luca] Univ Bari, Dipartimento Jonico, Taranto, Italy; [Moretto, Michele] Univ Padua, Dept Econ, Ctr Studi Levi Cases, Padua, Italy; [Vergalli, Sergio] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Brescia, Italy",,"Vergalli, S (corresponding author), Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Brescia, Italy.",sergio.vergalli@unibs.it,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2018.0,23,4,,,,413,433,,10.1017/S1355770X18000189,,,,,,,,WOS:000440008600002,

Conservation efforts in these post-frontier zones seek to protect the remaining forest fragments and promote sustainable agricultural practices that absorb labor, meet market demand, and generate ecosystem services. Assessments of these efforts often find that rates of sustained uptake are disappointingly low and that impacts are difficult to discern, but this could be due to the short-time frames of both the efforts themselves and their evaluation. We investigate the impacts of participation in an internationally sponsored farmer association that for 15 years promoted sustainable agricultural practices in the heavily deforested state of Rondonia, Brazil. Using data from a georeferenced four-period panel survey of farmers in combination with remote sensing data on land use spanning the life of the association, we apply matching methods to estimate the impacts of participation. We find that membership resulted in more diversified production systems, including more land allocated to agroforestry.

These contradictions often arise from limited thematic, sectoral, temporal, or spatial perspectives, and lead to misinterpretation. Our paper offers a comprehensive picture of discourses, policies, and socio-environmental dynamics for the entire region over the last five decades.

Location The tropical western Atlantic. Methods The geological history of the Amazon barrier was obtained from the literature, and its potential influence on speciation of reef fishes was analysed. Species distributions were analysed based on literature records and material deposited at Brazilian and American collections. Results Recent estimates indicate that about 12% of the Brazilian reef fish species are endemic, and most ichthyologists agree that this endemism is generated by the barrier formed by the freshwater and sediment discharge of large rivers in north-eastern South America, mainly the Amazon, Orinoco and their tributaries. However, little is known about the dynamics of this barrier, and recent studies have demonstrated that it can be crossed through deep sponge bottoms on the outer continental shelf off north-eastern South America. Moreover, the recent discovery of species regarded as Brazilian endemics in the extreme southern Caribbean is showing that the Amazon barrier is weaker than previously thought. Main conclusions The Amazon freshwater and sediment outflow is a strong barrier to shallow water reef fish and other organisms, and it is probably responsible for most of the endemism found in Brazilian coastal habitats. However, sea-level fluctuations influence the effectiveness of such barrier and may play a large role in the generation of diversity in the western tropical Atlantic. Alternatively, larval exchange between Brazil and the Caribbean is small but constant, and contrasting selection pressures in divergent environments (continental Brazil vs. insular Caribbean) may be the central force driving speciation.","Univ Florida, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA",,"Rocha, LA (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, 7922 NW 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA.",rocha@mail.ifas.ufl.edu,,,,,,,190,202,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2003.0,30,8,,,,1161,1171,,10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00900.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000184391000004,

Whereas postwar revisionist scholarship has tended to view migrants as stupefied by drought and duped by regime propaganda, this essay argues that labor flows to the Amazon must be understood in the context of broader historical patterns of Northeastern migration to the Amazon; the socioeconomic inequalities of the Northeast and the differential impact of drought on its peasantry; state policies to manage social crisis; wartime dislocations and opportunities; and the gendered and generational norms inflecting Northeastern migration.

Due to countervailing effects on deforestation of innovation inside and outside the Amazon - respectively, increasing and decreasing it - innovation in Brazilian agriculture in the period from 1985 to 1995 has not altered substantially deforestation rates. However, innovation inside the Amazon has to be reckoned as a driving force behind the continuing high levels of deforestation rates.

Recently established households practice slash-and-burn agriculture and participate in the overall deforestation of the Amazon. Near the Transamazon highway, these family agricultural practices are the main cause of deforestation. The study presented here is oriented toward a better understanding of the impacts of farming practices on soil chemical composition. This study used a sampling design based on soil samples taken on farm plots, which had been submitted to a wide range of spatial and temporal sequential land-uses, including soils that were only recently denuded. The data shows that soil responses (organic matter (OM) content, fertility and mercury (Hg) retention) to these varied land-uses were relatively similar, suggesting that the most important event determining the responses was deforestation itself. This is well illustrated by the Hg content of soils, which changed immediately after deforestation and then only slightly thereafter. This phenomenon could also be seen in the base cation (calcium (Ca), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg)) content which rose drastically after deforestation and tended to stay high for a period up to 10 years of cropping and pasture. This lasting cation rise is reflected by ammonium (NH4) displacement from surface soils. Indeed, inorganic nitrogen (N) is the most important nutrient loss upon deforestation. Nonetheless, when time spent in fallow was greater than 15 years, base cations (Ca, Mg, K), available N and phosphorus (P) contents tended to go back to initial forest soil values and in some cases to exceed them. Soil type was seen to mediate responses to land-use. Clay-sandy soils showed a lower content of available N and carbon (C) than clayey soils at the soil surface, a difference that was accentuated by deforestation. Conversely, the higher initial content of Hg in clayey soils was associated with a more important Hg loss from the soil's surface. By shedding light on the consequences of family practices for OM, nutrient status and Hg depletion, this paper gives a new perspective on soil responses to agricultural practices. These conclusions need to be addressed in a strategy plan to limit family land-use impacts on soils and the surrounding ecosystems. Recommendations for more sustainable land uses are proposed based on what has been learned about soil responses to local agricultural practices. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Total above-ground biomass (TAGB) ranged from 292 Mg ha(-1) to 436 Mg ha(-1). Coarse wood debris (> 20.5 cm diameter) was the dominant fuel component.

Total biomass consumption ranged from 42% to 57%. Fires resulted in the consumption of > 99% of the litter and rootmat, yet < 50% of the coarse wood debris. Dramatic losses in C, N and S were quantified. Lesser quantities of P, K, and Ca were lost by combustion processes. Carbon losses from the ecosystem were 58-112 Mg ha(-1). Nitrogen losses ranged from 817 to 1605 kg ha(-1) and S losses ranged from 92 to 122 kg ha(-1). This represents losses that are as high as 56%, 68%, and 49% of the total above-ground pools of these nutrients, respectively. Losses of P were as high as 20 kg ha(-1) or 32% of the above-ground pool. Losses to the atmosphere arising from primary slash fires were variable among sites due to site differences in concentration, fuel biomass, and fuel structure, climatic fluctuations, and anthropogenic influences. Compared to fires in other forest ecosystems, fires in slashed primary tropical evergreen forests result in among the highest total losses of nutrients ever measured. In addition, the proportion of the total nutrient pool lost from slash fires is higher in this ecosystem compared to other ecosystems due to a higher percentage of nutrients stored in above-ground biomass.","US FOREST SERV, INTERMT RES STN, MISSOULA, MT 59807 USA",,"KAUFFMAN, JB (corresponding author), OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,,209,220,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,1995.0,104,4,,,,397,408,,10.1007/BF00341336,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TJ37500001,

The sites were located in open, dense, and ecotone (to savanna) forest types. The TAGB of open forest ranged from 288 to 346 Mg ha(-1), with a mean of 313 Mg ha(-1); dense forest TAGB ranged from 298 to 533 Mg ha(-1), with a mean of 377 Mg ha(-1); and ecotone forests TAGB ranged from 298 to 422 Mg ha(-1), with a mean of 350 Mg ha(-1). Mean TAGB for all 20 sites was 341 Mg ha(-1). live trees (broad-leaved trees) comprised most of TAGB, averaging 280 Mg ha(-1). Mean aboveground biomass of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) differed between open (239 Mg ha(-1)) and dense forests (307 Mg ha(-1)). Mean biomass of live nontree components (predominantly palms) for all 20 sites was 22 Mg ha(-1). The combined biomass of coarse wood debris, forest floor (litter/rootmat), and standing dead plants (trees, palms and vines) averaged 38 Mg ha(-1) or 12% of the TAGB. Forest structure and biomass distribution were not uniform among sites or forest types. For example, non-tree components ranged from 41% of the TAGB in one ecotone forest to as low as 7% in a dense forest site. Non-tree components comprised 22% of TAGB. This is noteworthy because the non-tree components are often omitted from forest biomass/carbon pool estimates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is also home to a quarter of all global diversity. Large swathes of forest are removed each year, and many models have attempted to predict the spatial patterns of this forest loss. The spatial patterns of deforestation are determined largely by the patterns of roads that open access to frontier areas and expansion of the road network in the Amazon is largely determined by profit seeking logging activities. Here we present predictions for the spatial distribution of standing value of timber across the Amazon. We show that the patterns of timber value reflect large-scale ecological gradients, determining the spatial distribution of functional traits of trees which are, in turn, correlated with timber values. We expect that understanding the spatial patterns of timber value across the Amazon will aid predictions of logging movements and thus predictions of potential future road developments. These predictions in turn will be of great use in estimating the spatial patterns of deforestation in this globally important biome.","[Ahmed, Sadia E.; Ewers, Robert M.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Ascot, Berks, England",,"Ahmed, SE (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot, Berks, England.",sadia.ahmed05@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 8,2012.0,7,5,,,,,,e36099,10.1371/journal.pone.0036099,,,,,,,,WOS:000305335500006,

Publicly available information about the location and extent of the transmission line network in the Amazon is neither accurate nor current, and its environmental impacts on terrestrial ecosystems have not been assessed on a large scale. This study estimates the scale of the impact of the current and planned transmission and distribution line network using a hand-digitized dataset and the predicted impact area determined from Environmental Impact Assessments. The Legal Amazon region contains 39,625 km of verified transmission and distribution lines, estimated to directly impact 23,467 km(2) of land. We find that the transmission line network directly impacts double the area flooded by hydroelectric reservoirs in the Legal Amazon. Of the direct impact area, 5.1% is within protected areas and 10.3% overlaps with intact forest. By 2026, the transmission line network is estimated to grow by 37% in the Legal Amazon, increasing the direct impact to forests by 70% and to protected lands by 29%. Transmission lines are impacting enough land to be considered a serious conservation threat and should be treated as such in research and environmental planning in the Amazon region.","[Hyde, Jacy L.; Bohlman, Stephanie A.; Valle, Denis] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, 136 Newins Zeigler Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Hyde, JL (corresponding author), 136 Newins Zeigler Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jlhyde@ufl.edu; sbohlman@ufl.edu; drvalle@ufl.edu,,,,,,,6,7,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2018.0,228,,,,,343,356,,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.10.027,,,,,,,,WOS:000452815200037,

A hierarchical-based classification method was used to classify Landsat images into thematic maps. This research shows different spatiotemporal change patterns, composition, and rates among the three study areas and indicates the importance of analysing LULC change at multiple scales. The LULC change analysis over time for entire study areas provides an overall picture of change trends, but detailed change trajectories and their spatial distributions can be better examined at a per-pixel scale. The LULC change at the polygon scale provides the information of the changes in patch sizes over time, while the LULC change at census sector scale gives new insights on how human-induced activities (e.g. urban expansion, roads, and land-use history) affect LULC change patterns and rates.

Firstly, the article places the concept of ecocide within the context of the international governance framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the challenges that natural resource exploitation presents to the achievement of sustainable development in Latin America. Secondly, it presents an overview of the concept of ecocide that includes cultural genocide as a method for undermining a way of life and a technique for group destruction. Lastly, through an analysis of Brazil's environmental politics, contested claims of sovereignty and the recent push for the industrialisation of the Amazon, the article considers whether claims of ecocide in the Brazilian Amazon can be substantiated when using the criteria for the crime of ecocide - namely the size, duration and impact of the extensive damage to, destruction of or loss of ecosystems in the Amazon rainforest.","[Raftopoulos, Malayna] Aalborg Univ, Dept Polit & Soc, Aalborg, Denmark; [Morley, Joanna] Univ Liverpool, Dept Modern Languages & Cultures, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",,"Raftopoulos, M (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Polit & Soc, Aalborg, Denmark.",raftopoulos@dps.aau.dk,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 25,2020.0,24,10,,,,1616,1641,,10.1080/13642987.2020.1746648,,MAR 2020,,,,,,WOS:000523650100001,

The algorithm is validated against independent in situ data and is found to be valid in the range of SSS from 29 to 35 psu, for the period of highest rates of Amazon River discharge with RMSE=0.79 psu and r(2)=0.84.

Anuario Estatistico do Brasil, Vol. 51. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil pp. 1-1024). We have used vegetation greenness estimates from satellite images as inputs to a terrestrial ecosystem production model. This carbon allocation model generates new estimates of regional aboveground vegetation biomass at 8-km resolution. The modeled biomass product is then combined for the first time with fire pixel counts from the advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) to overlay regional burning activities in the Amazon. Results from our analysis indicate that carbon emission estimates from annual region-wide sources of deforestation and biomass burning in the early 1990s are apparently three to five times higher than reported in previous studies for the Brazilian Legal Amazon (Houghton et al., 2000.

In contrast, our analysis implies that the total source fluxes over the entire Legal Amazon region range from 0.2 to 1.2Pg Cyr(-1), depending strongly on annual rainfall patterns. The reasons for our higher burning emission estimates are (1) use of combustion fractions typically measured during Amazon forest burning events for computing carbon losses, (2) more detailed geographic distribution of vegetation biomass and daily fire activity for the region, and (3) inclusion of fire effects in extensive areas of the Legal Amazon covered by open woodland, secondary forests, savanna, and pasture vegetation.

This analysis goes beyond previous estimates for reactive gas emissions from Amazon fires, owing to a more detailed geographic distribution estimate of vegetation biomass, coupled with daily fire activity for the region (original 1 km resolution), and inclusion of fire effects in extensive areas of the Legal Amazon (defined as the Brazilian states of Acre, Amapa, Amazonas, Maranhao, Mato Grosso, Para, Rondonia, Roraima, and Tocantins) covered by open woodland, secondary forests, savanna, and pasture vegetation. Results from our emissions model indicate that annual emissions from Amazon deforestation and biomass burning in the early 1990s total to 102 Tg yr(-1) carbon monoxide (CO) and 3.5 Tg yr(-1) nitrogen oxides (NOx). Peak daily burning emissions, which occurred in early September 1992, were estimated at slightly more than 3 Tg d(-1) for CO and 0.1 Tg d(-1) for NOx flux to the atmosphere. Other burning source fluxes of gases with relatively high emission factors are reported, including methane (CH4), nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), in addition to total particulate matter (TPM). We estimate the Brazilian Amazon region to be a source of between one fifth and one third for each of these global emission fluxes to the atmosphere. The regional distribution of burning emissions appears to be highest in the Brazilian states of Maranhao and Tocantins, mainly from burning outside of moist forest areas, and in Para and Mato Grosso, where we identify important contributions from primary forest cutting and burning. These new daily emission estimates of reactive gases from biomass burning fluxes are designed to be used as detailed spatial and temporal inputs to computer models and data analysis of tropospheric chemistry over the tropical region.","NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Ecosyst Sci & Technol Branch, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Seaside, CA USA",,"Potter, C (corresponding author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Ecosyst Sci & Technol Branch, Mail Stop 242-4, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",cpotter@gaia.arc.nasa.gov,,,,,,,18,18,,,,,,,,,,,SEP-OCT,2002.0,107,D20,,,,,,8056,10.1029/2000JD000250,,,,,,,,WOS:000180466200013,

Lignin biomarkers have been analyzed from sediment cores collected in three floodplain lakes and in suspended particulate matter sampled during both wet and dry seasons. These analyses are interpreted with regard to lignin biomarker signatures of surface and deeper horizons of common soils, and of dominant plant species from forested and deforested environments. Dating the sediment cores with Pb-210 allows reconstructing the successive deforestation cycles since the onset of European colonization two centuries ago. Further, satellite images coupled to a GIS approach is used to correlate the evolution of sedimentary TOM and anthropogenic land-use from 1986 to 2009. Over this period, sedimentation rates have sharply increased, and the nature of the sedimentary TOM has been shifted from being linked to primeval forest soils to degraded soils following deforestation for subsistence cropping and/or pasture lands. The intensity of changes in the nature of sedimentary TOM appears inversely related to the connectivity of flood lakes to the river. In the least connected flood lake, weathering of pasture soils in the watershed dominates TOM inputs particularly during the dry season. Massive deforestation in the Amazon thus triggers major changes in the nature of TOM transferred and sedimented in aquatic systems.","[Belanger, Emilie; Lucotte, Marc; Moingt, Matthieu; Paquet, Serge; Oestreicher, Jordan; Rozon, Christine] Univ Quebec, Geotop, Inst Sci Environm, CP 8888,Suc Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",,"Moingt, M (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Geotop, Inst Sci Environm, CP 8888,Suc Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",moingt.matthieu@uqam.ca,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2017.0,87,,,,,136,145,,10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.10.016,,,,,,,,WOS:000416485300012,

The computation of localized parameters is based on geographically weighted regression (GWR). The novelty of this paper lies in its incorporation of economic, rather than Euclidean, distances into the GWR. Economic distances are measured by travel time, sourced from Google Inc. A global approach revealed several important factors that affect deforestation, including: rural population, GDP (suggesting a U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve), forest stock, cattle ranching, timber value, and road networks (both official and unofficial). Local analysis uncovered patterns not seen under global models, especially in the state of Para. Most notably, crop cultivation was found to accelerate deforestation in southeastern Para and northeastern Mato Grosso, while in some regions (especially in the northeastern corner of Para), the area covered by crop plantations was negatively associated with deforestation. For Para, rural credit constraints, larger territories designated as sustainable use areas and indigenous lands, and higher levels of precipitation inhibit deforestation. Further, rural population has a very heterogeneous impact on deforestation across Legal Amazon: it is not a significant factor of deforestation in northern Para and Amapa, but it has a relatively strong effect in the western parts of Mato Grosso and Rondonia. Also, official and illegal roads create significantly more pressure on forests in remote regions compared to developed areas. Finally, the use of economic distances, as opposed to Euclidean distances, leads to notably different GWR results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Appealing for its ambitious aspiration to harmonize sustainable economic development at the local level with the conservation of legally established protected areas (e.g., parks and reserves), the ICDP approach recently has drawn criticism from conservation biologists for failing to ensure adequate protection of biodiversity. Development planners and economists have also raised questions about the financial sustainability of ICDPs in practice and the replicability of the model from highly local contexts to larger regional scales, This paper briefly reviews the central elements of the concept of integrated conservation and development and the emerging debate over its effectiveness, A description of the Community Initiative Program (CIP), a pilot program of the Rondonia Natural Resources Management project (PLANAFLORO) in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia, follows. The CIP is a significant experiment because it boldly attempted to apply the principles of ICDP to the regional scale involving numerous different communities in one program simultaneously. Based on the author's mid-term review of the CIP in 1999, the development and conservation impacts of the program are considered. While the CIP has not significantly curbed the degradation of protected areas in Rondonia as intended, the evidence suggests lower rates of deforestation in municipios (i.e. counties) with the highest concentrations of CIP projects, Although the economic development impacts are mixed, approximately 50% of the projects delivered tangible benefits to local communities. Lessons learned from the CIP are presented in the final section. Among the lessons learned from the CIP, detailed in the final section, are several that will be familiar to other ICDP evaluators: the importance of thematic coherence in initial project design, the need for explicit attention on environmental conservation objectives, deficient institutional capacity of implementing organizations, inadequate attention to women's concerns and roles in community projects, and lack of technical criteria for measuring project sustainability.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Urban Affairs & Planning, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",,"Browder, JO (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Urban Affairs & Planning, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,,30,30,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2002.0,29,6,,,,750,762,,10.1007/s00267-001-2613-3,,,,,,,,WOS:000175552200003,

Brazil has taken several steps to reduce emissions associated with deforestation including the development of policies to promote and reward cattle ranching intensification. Intensification practices are hypothesized to reduce the conversion of tropical forests while simultaneously increasing the productivity of ranching on current pasture lands. This paper assesses the impact of intensification on the demand for productive land. A theoretical model of land use, which considers the degree of intensification in the estimation of the derived demand for pasture, is tested with data from small-scale landowners who operate dairy farms and calving operations in the greater Ouro Preto do Oeste region of Rondonia. Results suggest different trajectories for beef and dairy production. The intensification of cattle production exhibits a nonlinear relationship with the demand for productive land: first as farms become more intensive the demand for newly cleared land increases, but then decreases with further intensification. The results are different for dairy intensification, which is found to be correlated with reduced deforestation. Findings suggest that the reliance on policies that promote intensification can be a risky way of achieving climate change objectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This quantitative analysis shows that owners who participate in one union with state-controlled, corporatist roots are more likely to possess secure title to their land than those who do not participate.

The concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon varied from one river to another and according to the season, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) always accounted for about 70% of the total organic carbon (TOC). The mean concentration of dissolved organic carbon was 6.1 mg l(-1) in the Madeira River, 5.83 mg l(-1) in the Solimoes River and 12.7 mg l(-1) in the Negro River. The percentage in weight of the particulate organic carbon decreased as the concentration of suspended matter increased. The Solimoes River contributed the most carbon to the Amazon River: about 500 kg C s(-1) during the high water period and about 300 kg C s(-1) during the low water period. However, the temporal variations in organic carbon in the Amazon River (i.e. downstream of Manaus) are basically controlled by inputs from the Negro River and its variations. The Negro River does not produce a simple dilution effect. During the high water period (between March and August) the TOC flux, calculated as the sum of the Solimoes, Negro and Madeira tributaries, was about 5.7 x 10(13) g C yr(-1), whereas during the low water period (between September and February) the TOC flux was about 2.6 x 10(13) g C yr(-1). The mean annual flux of TOC at Obidos (the final gauging station upstream of the estuary) was about 3.27 x 10(13) g C yr(-1) (i.e. 32.7 +/- 3.3 Tg yr(-1)). Of this, the flux of DOC represents about 2.7 x 10(13) g C yr(-1) and the flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) represents about 0.5 x 10(13) g C yr(-1). The mean annual input of TOC by all tributaries (Negro, Solimoes, Madeira, Trombetas, Tapajos and Xingu) was about 2.8 x 10(13) g C yr(-1). When we compared this input with the output recorded at Obidos (3.27 x 10(13) g C yr(-1)), we found that the amount of organic carbon increased (about 0.4 x 10(13) g C yr(-1)). This shows that other important sources of organic carbon exist in the lower reaches of the Amazon River. These inputs can be attributed to the adjacent floodplain lake system, called 'varzea'.

It specifically analyses the role of pro-environment and pro-development policy networks in affecting policy design and implementation. It argues that the efforts of environmentalist networks trying to advocate or block relative developmentalist policies in the Amazon depend on three critical factors whether they are able to attract the support of elites (or at least block their developmentalist policy initiatives); the type and level of international support they have; and the organizational and financial resources that they are able to mobilize. In analysing the four periods, this article finds that while international influences and resources have been substantial in enabling environmentalist networks to flourish and influence the policy, their effectiveness has been nearly always outweighed by Brazilian developmentalist interests. The outcome in each phase has been a different form of stalemate on environmental protection, and the deforestation continued each time, albeit at slower rates. These findings suggest that the key for significantly lower rates of deforestation on the Amazon may be in the ability of pro-environment networks to neutralize opposition by creating an incentive structure that 'compensates' potential losers of policies that promote conservation.","[Lemos, Maria Carmen; Roberts, J.

The settlement history of the region contributes directly to the way in which soy agriculture is currently proceeding in Santarem. Government policies and perspectives have been shaped by a history of agrarian colonization of Amazon forests, and the small farmers, or colonos, who are now being bought out by soy agribusiness are also rooted in this history. As a means of ascertaining the current state and interaction of soy actors with the burgeoning soy-based economy in the area, field research was conducted on the role of primary and secondary forests for soy production. Research also included an analysis of valuation discourses - that is, how the differing soy actors (local government, agribusiness, conservation NGOs, and small farmers) assign value to types of forests and their different interpretations of what constitutes environmental degradation. The ways in which these different actors assign such values to forests and how they structure the definition of environmental degradation is a key factor in determining who wins and loses in the realm of Amazon development. Significant environmental and socio-economic implications of soy expansion, especially for the colonos, are not taken into account because the dominant rhetoric of Amazonian development ignores their contribution to social and ecological diversity. This omission keeps colono communities living at poverty level and even exacerbates colono poverty under the soy development project. The colonos and their representatives are responding by setting forth their own, competing valuations of primary and secondary forests that contrast sharply with state soy growing schemes and NGO plans for sustainable soy. These have their roots in local knowledge and best practices.","Grassroots Int, Boston, MA 02130 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",,"Steward, C (corresponding author), Grassroots Int, 179 Boylston St,4th Floor, Boston, MA 02130 USA.",corrina.steward@aya.yale.edu,,,,,,,46,48,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2007.0,24,1,,,,107,122,,10.1007/s10460-006-9030-4,,,,,,,,WOS:000244446700009,

However, small scale farmers tend nowadays to re-burn secondary forests as soon as after 3 to 5 years, thus could contribute to further reduce soil fertility and could enhance the transfer of mercury (Hg) naturally present in soils of the region towards water courses. The present research project sets out to characterize the impact of forested fallows of differing age and land-use history on soils properties (fertility and Hg contents) in the region of the Tapajos River, an active pioneer front of the Brazilian Amazon. To do this, soil samples in forested fallows of variable age and in control primary forests were retrieved. In general, soil fertility of grouped forested fallows of different ages was similar to that of the primary forests. But when discriminating soils according to their texture, forested fallows on coarse grained soils still had much higher NH4/NO3 ratios, NH4 and Ca contents than primary forests, this even 15 years after burning. The impact of repeated burnings was also assessed. Fallows on coarse grained soils showed an impoverishment for all variables related to fertility when the number of burnings was 5 or more. For fallows on fine grained soils that underwent 5 or more burnings, NO3 contents were low although a cation enrichment was observed. Total soil Hg content was also sensitive to repeated burnings, showing similar losses for forested fallows established on both types of soil. However, Hg linked to coarse particles appeared to migrate back towards fine particles at the surface of coarse grained soils in fallows older than 7 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using household survey data from 1,293 individuals in the two cities, we employ an event history model to assess factors associated with migration and a binary logit model to understand factors associated with remitting behavior. We find that in Altamira, migration tends to be an individual-level opportunistic strategy fostered by extra-local family networks, while in Santar,m, migration tends to be a household-level strategy driven by socioeconomic deprivation and accompanied by remittances.

To elucidate the difference in crop selection tendencies between households with production sales and those without sales, we categorised the households within a single study area in Brazil into three types: (1) households with sales income from agricultural products (SA), and households without sales income in which the variety among cultivated crops was (2) low (NL) or (3) high (NH).

Our goal in building the model was to construct a relatively simple ecosystem model that would respond to soil and climatic heterogeneity that allows us to study the impact of Amazonian deforestation, selective logging and accidental fire on the global carbon cycle. This paper focuses on the net flux caused by deforestation and forest re-growth over the period from 1970 to 1998. We calculate that the net flux to the atmosphere during this period reached a maximum of similar to0.35 PgC yr(-1) (1 PgC= 1 x 10(15) gC) in 1990, with a cumulative release of similar to7 PgC from 1970 to 1998. The net flux is higher than predicted by an earlier study (Houghton et al., 2000) by a total of 1 PgC over the period 1989-1998 mainly because CARLUC predicts relatively high mature forest carbon storage compared with the datasets used in the earlier study. Incorporating the dynamics of litter and soil carbon pools into the model increases the cumulative net flux bysimilar to1 PgC from 1970 to 1998, while different assumptions about land-cover dynamics only caused small changes. The uncertainty of the net flux, calculated with a Monte-Carlo approach, is roughly 35% of the mean value (1 SD).","Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA",,"Hirsch, AI (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",adam.hirsch@noaa.gov,,,,,,,67,71,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2004.0,10,5,,,,908,924,,10.1111/j.1529-8817.2003.00765.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000221421600027,

Current literature emphasizes how land clearing increases malaria incidence, leading to the conclusion that forest conservation decreases malaria burden. Yet, there is also evidence that proximity to forest fringes increases malaria incidence, which implies the opposite relationship between forest conservation and malaria. We compare the effect of these environmental factors on malaria and explore its implications. Methods and Findings: Using a large malaria dataset (similar to 1,300,000 positive malaria tests collected over similar to 4.5 million km(2)), satellite imagery, permutation tests, and hierarchical Bayesian regressions, we show that greater forest cover (as a proxy for proximity to forest fringes) tends to be associated with higher malaria incidence, and that forest cover effect was 25 times greater than the land clearing effect, the often cited culprit of malaria in the region. These findings have important implications for land use/land cover (LULC) policies in the region. We find that cities close to protected areas (PA's) tend to have higher malaria incidence than cities far from PA's. Using future LULC scenarios, we show that avoiding 10% of deforestation through better governance might result in an average 2-fold increase in malaria incidence by 2050 in urban health posts. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cost analysis of reduced carbon emissions from conservation efforts in the region should account for increased malaria morbidity, and that conservation initiatives should consider adopting malaria mitigation strategies. Coordinated actions from disparate science fields, government ministries, and global initiatives (e. g., Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation; Millenium Development Goals; Roll Back Malaria; and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), will be required to decrease malaria toll in the region while preserving these important ecosystems.","[Valle, Denis] Duke Univ, Univ Program Ecol, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Clark, James] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Dept Biol, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Valle, D (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Univ Program Ecol, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",drv4@duke.edu,,,,,,,41,41,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 6,2013.0,8,3,,,,,,e57519,10.1371/journal.pone.0057519,,,,,,,,WOS:000316936100028,

When caregivers in two peri-urban neighborhoods, Triunfo and Bairro da Luz, discuss medicinal plants they highlight the positive aspects of phytotherapy and associate it with traditional rural lifestyles. In contrast, they tend to emphasize the shortcomings of pharmaceuticals, which they link to modernity and urbanization. This discourse, which juxtaposes plants/tradition/positive with pharmaceuticals/modern/negative, contains counterhegemonic commentary about the failures of modernization, urbanization and development. While state sponsored development was supposed to bring prosperity to the Amazon, for many residents, like those in Bairro de Luz and Triunfo, it did not. In fact, some say development made their lives worse, claiming that poverty and poor health are among the prices they have paid. Due to the shortcomings of modernization and urbanization in other areas of their life, caregivers are ambivalent about biomedicine and the pharmaceuticals they associate with it. Moreover, because medicinal plant remedies embody traditional values, asserting they are stronger, more potent, better and more effective, especially in an urban context, is a moral commentary on the shortcomings of modernity. Finally, by insisting that traditional plant remedies are better at curing the health problems that result from modern, urban lifestyles, they are subtly asserting the superiority of tradition over modernity.

Focusing on the Brazilian Amazon from 1870 to 1910, the analysis develops a new theoretical framework constructed by combining standard trade models with institutions and economic geography. There are two levels of analysis: interactions among and within different nodes of the commodity chain. A quantitative-driven analysis from macroeconomic data supports inferences from microeconomic behavior. The thesis provides new information on rubber prices and exports, trader ledgers, estate accounts, newspapers, traveler accounts, and official documents. The research develops a demand-and supply-side analysis of the history of rubber, from tappers to manufacturers. It features the main rubber manufacturing countries, Britain and the U.S.A., and shows how competition prevailed along the chain, translating into a struggle for rubber supply. Rubber was not a homogeneous product. Due to a combination of quantity and quality, the Brazilian Amazon possessed significant market power, market power that shaped the rubber chain. In this light, the thesis investigates how the Brazilian rubber supply chain was organized and how agents profited from its monopolistic position. It also shows that taxation increased the regional welfare and allowed the government to support two related activities: telegraphs and shipping. The thesis proves that violence and coercion were not necessary features of rubber production, as argued by much of the literature. Through a game theoretic approach, the thesis demonstrates conditions under which production could have occurred without exploitation. In a context of high price inelasticity of demand and rising prices, production was driven by market forces. Inelasticity of demand was indeed one of the main features of the rubber boom. It shaped production, bargaining power between different nodes of the chain and competition within them, defining the distribution of profits along the rubber chain.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Fernandes, FT (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2010.0,11,4,,,,675,685,,10.1093/es/khq078,,,,,,,,WOS:000284457000001,

This paper introduces a dynamic model of resource exploitation to explain how regions may succumb to, avoid or escape this negative outcome. The theoretical model characterizes a frontier community that uses soil as an input into agricultural production. The model shows that there may be a critical point in the soil stock that determines whether agricultural activities lead to sustainable development or a collapse in local income. This suggests that, in the event of a resource collapse, temporary adjustments to the system may permanently rehabilitate the resource base and change a community's development pattern.

Much attention in the historical literature on Amazonia has focused on the largest and most famous regional economic boom, the Rubber Boom, a period of sustained economic prosperity for some from 1860 to 1920. Other 'booms' have occurred in the region as well and this paper describes and discusses one of those others. The paper demonstrates how an export economy in a global periphery (coffee in Brazil) affected economic development in a periphery of that same country and makes a methodological contribution by demonstrating how ethnographic research can contribute to an understanding of a historical period when the paper trail is weak. Jute, a fiber crop, dominated agricultural production along the Amazon River flood plain in the reach between Manaus and Santarem, Brazil, from the late 1930s until the early 1990s. The crop was introduced to the region by Japanese immigrants in order to supply the demand for jute sacking in the south of Brazil where such sacks were used to package commodities, especially coffee. Local smallholder cultivators grew and processed jute, production being mediated initially through Japanese middlemen, later by Brazilians. Poor fiber quality, several external shocks, including the removal of tariffs on imported jute, and especially changes in commodity packaging such as bulk handling and the use of synthetic sacks instead of jute sacks for the transport of coffee beans, the Amazonian jute market collapsed in the early 1990s. Despite its collapse, the legacy of the boom is still evident in the physical and social landscapes in the region. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

I derive a deforestation equation from this model and test a number of those factors using county-level data for the period 1978-1988. The data include a satellite deforestation measure which allows improved within-country analysis. The major empirical finding is the significance of both land characteristics (such as soil quality and vegetation density) and factors affecting transport costs (such as distance to major markets and both own- and neighboring-county roads). Government development projects also appear to affect clearing, although credit infrastructure does not. However, as such policies themselves may be functions of other factors, estimated effects of policies must be interpreted with some caution. Finally, the population density does not have a significant effect on deforestation when many potential determinants are included. However, a quadratic specification reveals a more robust result: the first migrants to a county have greater impact than later immigrants. This implies that the distribution of population affects its impact.

However, the significance of rubber tapping itself has declined since the creation of extractive reserves, which raises questions about the contemporary cultural content of the rubber tapper identity. This paper therefore evaluates rubber tapper identity, using the case of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve (CMER) in Acre, Brazil. We first draw on household survey data from the CMER to construct a statistical model of who self-identifies as a rubber tapper. The model shows that socio-economic background, household assets, institutional context, and knowledge of the CMER's management plan are relevant to understanding rubber tapper self-identification, but not resource management practices, including rubber tapping itself. We therefore pursue qualitative analysis of key informant interviews to better apprehend contemporary understandings of the rubber tapper identity, particularly in light of recent shifts in livelihoods from rubber tapping toward cattle ranching. The qualitative analysis shows that there are now several different foundations for self-identifying as a rubber tapper, and that there are disagreements concerning the acceptability of cattle ranching among rubber tappers. These findings bear implications for research on the relationship of livelihood-based identities with resource management practices and environmental change, as well as public policies that seek to reconcile regional development with forest conservation.

We build on the literature on rural livelihoods in the Global South by exploring how the opportunity to work off the farm is embedded in social relationships. We additionally differentiate our analysis by type of off-farm work, and examine how other characteristics such as human capital, the available labor supply, and access to infrastructure vary by work outcome. In general, the factors that contribute to more secure, relatively higher-paying work differ from those important in understanding patterns of lower-paying, daily wage work. We find that on-farm social capital, measured as the presence of a co-resident on the property who works off the farm, increases an individual's probability of working off the farm, but has a stronger effect for lower-wage work. We also find that the farm owner's relationship to households on the farm property plays a significant role in predicting patterns of off-farm work. These findings suggest that social capital plays an important role in providing access to employment and therefore to cash income, but that farm-level social capital does not necessarily provide pathways to stable or high-paying jobs outside agriculture.","[VanWey, Leah; Vithayathil, Trina] Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Populat Studies & Training Ctr, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [VanWey, Leah] Brown Univ, Environm Change Initiat, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Vithayathil, Trina] Brown Univ, Grad Program Dev, Providence, RI 02912 USA",,"VanWey, L (corresponding author), Brown Univ, MS 1916,Maxcy Hall, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Leah_Vanwey@brown.edu,,,,,,,15,15,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2013.0,78,1,,,,29,50,,10.1111/j.1549-0831.2012.00094.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000315595100002,

Studies in historical ecology refute this view. Rather than pristine tropical forest, some areas are better viewed as constructed or 'domesticated' landscapes, dramatically altered by indigenous groups in the past. This paper reviews recent archaeological research in several areas along the Amazon River with evidence of large pre-European (ca 400-500 calendar years before the present) occupations and large-scale transformations of forest and wetland environments. Research from the southern margins of closed tropical forest, in the headwaters of the Xingu River, are highlighted as an example of constructed nature in the Amazon. In all cases, human influences dramatically altered the distribution, frequency and configurations of biological communities and ecological settings.

Our results provide unbiased forest loss area estimates, which confirm the reduction of primary forest clearing (deforestation) documented by official maps. By the end of the study period, nonprimary forest clearing, together with primary forest degradation within the BLA, became comparable in area to deforestation, accounting for an estimated 53% of gross tree cover loss area and 26 to 35% of gross aboveground carbon loss. The main type of tree cover loss in all forest types was agroindustrial clearing for pasture (63% of total loss area), followed by small-scale forest clearing (12%) and agroindustrial clearing for cropland (9%), with natural woodlands being directly converted into croplands more often than primary forests. Fire accounted for 9% of the 2000-2013 primary forest disturbance area, with peak disturbances corresponding to droughts in 2005, 2007, and 2010. The rate of selective logging exploitation remained constant throughout the study period, contributing to forest fire vulnerability and degradation pressures.

Results show that while the extent and rate of deforestation in the region are important, they are less than previously reported. Forest fragmentation, however, adds a significant level of impact by affecting a very large proportion of the remaining forest cover. Better understanding of the dynamics and patterns of deforestation at regional, national and global levels requires the study of a representative number of areas.

Being the most biodiverse place on the planet, deforestation of the Amazon leads to threats and extinctions of animal and plant species. The main causes of deforestation in the Amazon are land conversion for agriculture (mainly cattle, also soy), practices that are mostly illegal.

Consequently, variation in canopy cover affects the composition and distribution of plant species via creating variable light environments. Nevertheless, little is known about how variation in canopy openness structures patterns of plant-animal interactions. Because of the great diversity and dominance of ants in tropical environments, we used ant-plant interactions as a focal network to evaluate how variation in canopy cover influences patterns of plant-insect interactions in the Brazilian Amazon rain forest. We observed that small increases in canopy openness are associated with increased diversity of ant-plant interactions in our study area, and this change is independent of plant or ant species richness. Additionally, we found smaller niche overlap for both ants and plants associated with greater canopy openness. We hypothesize that enhanced light availability increases the breadth of ant foraging sources because variation in light availability gives rise to plant resources of different quality and amounts. Moreover, greater light availability promotes vegetative growth in plants, creating ant foraging bridges' between plants. In sum, our results highlight the importance of environmental heterogeneity as a determinant of ant-plant interaction diversity in tropical environments.

The framing of responsibility for the fires is focused on president Bolsonaro, who is assembled in many tweets, while animals and indigenous people are framed as victims.

This estimated parameter has two advantages over conventional estimates. First, it is a general, average estimate that can be used in macro-scale economic analysis. Second, the estimate is derived from regional data accessible to economists rather than from remote scientific stations. In the first stage a model is estimated that tracks the transition of land use from period to period for each municipality, allowing the process to vary according to different characteristics of each municipality and time period. From this land use transition model the percentage of crop land in each municipality that is recently cleared, 5-years old, 10 years old or previously used for other purposes is calculated. These land vintage estimates are used with labor as inputs in a Cobb-Douglas production function which is estimated using GLS. The estimated elasticities are allowed to vary by relevant municipality characteristics and are then converted into a measure of productivity for each land vintage. It is shown that the productivity of land drops in the first 5-years after clearing land and stabilizes thereafter. Several economic arguments are given to support the empirical results.

As an application example, an MPAC-based three-stage classifier is applied to degraded forest detection in Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of the Brazilian Amazon, where intermediate states of forest alterations caused by anthropogenic activities can be characterized by image structures 1-3 pixels wide. In three TM images of the Para test site, where classification results are validated by means of qualitative and quantitative comparisons with aerial photos, degraded forest areas cover 13 % to 45 % of the image ground coverage. In the Mato Grosso test site, the degraded forest class overlaps with 1) 10% of the closed-canopy forest detected by the deforestation mapping program of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 1992), and 2) 19 % of the closed-canopy forest detected by the Tropical Rain Forest Information Center (TRFIC, 1996).

Understanding this land use transition requires a theorization of the relationships among environmental governance, agricultural intensification, and state building. Drawing on key informant interviews, municipal-level case studies, and an organizational ethnography of an international environmental organization, I argue that declines in deforestation engineered by new governance arrangements are part of a project of economic development and state building through environmental regulation. This project is implemented by a complex of government, nongovernmental, and corporate actors. I describe the emergence of this complex and the land sparing logic that animates it. Land sparing policy inverts previous logics of state territorialization and environmental conservation with the aim of shifting the Amazonian economy from an extensive mode of extraction to an intensive mode of production. Two municipal case studies follow variation in land sparing policy implementation. The cases identify determinants of land sparing policy effectiveness and collateral effects, including tendencies toward agro-industrial consolidation at the expense of smallholders.","[Thaler, Gregory M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Thaler, GM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",gmt45@cornell.edu,,,,,,,22,22,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,107,6,,,,1424,1443,,10.1080/24694452.2017.1309966,,,,,,,,WOS:000413770400011,

However, the expansion of logging presents a danger for curtailing forest degradation, fires, and corruption that is linked to the fast returns from sale of timber, especially inside conservation areas that have been mostly intact until now.

These values are distinct from those of POC from rivers draining nonforested (grassland/woodland) catchments, which are generally higher than -26%o. The difference is due to the presence in the nonforested regions, of grasses which assimilate carbon via the C-4 photosynthetic pathway (average delta C-13 = similar to-13(0)/(0o)), rather than the C3 pathway (average delta C-13 = similar to-28%o) utilized by forest vegetation, and to negligible utilization of low -delta C-13 respired carbon dioxide in regions of open vegetation. A change in the area of the Basin covered by closed forest will lead to a modification in the carbon isotope composition of exported POC as a result of changing (1) the proportion of C4 carbon in the total biomass (2) the relative proportion of the total POC derived from upstream, high-altitude (Andean) sources, (3) erosion rates, and (4) productivity. All of these factors will tend to reinforce each other in their effect on the carbon isotope composition of POC exported from the Basin, with a decrease in forest area leading to an increase in the delta C-13 value of POC (and vice versa). There is a sufficient difference between the delta C-13 values of POC exported from forested and non forested catchments to elucidate past vegetation and therefore climatic changes in the Amazon Basin (and other tropical river basins), using the delta C-13 record in POC from either terrestrial or offshore sedimentary sequences. The carbon isotope composition of POC in rivers draining recently deforested regions indicates that the isotopic composition of coarse (>63 mu m) riverine POC will respond to vegetation changes in a catchment within years to decades, whereas the delta C-13 value of fine-grained (<63 mu m) riverine POC may take longer to respond.","[Bird, M.; Chivas, A.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Fyfe, W.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geol, London, ON, Canada; [Pinheiro-Dick, D.] Tech Univ, Inst Bodenkunde, D-8050 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",,"Bird, MI (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",,,,,,,,44,54,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,1992.0,6,3,,,,293,306,,10.1029/92GB01652,,,,,,,,WOS:000211488400006,

Only in 30% of the cases reviewed could smallholders commercialize tree products. Cultivated non-timber forest products had the highest commercialisation rates. The growing of single trees within farm holdings, and the management of natural stands and homegardens showed the highest production efficiencies while depending on minimal inputs.

This article utilizes a high-resolution, Landsat-based data-set called TerraClass to relate land abandonment to precipitation, slope, farmgate price of beef, market access, soil quality, and land tenure characteristics in the Brazilian Amazon. The spatially explicit statistical models reveal that rates of land abandonment increase with higher rainfall and slope values, even when controlling for distance to roads, farmgate prices, type of settlement, and soil quality. Moreover, land adjacent to a major road is more likely to be consistently cultivated, but land near large rivers and far from highways is more likely to be abandoned. Land ownership type also influences the likelihood of land abandonment as settlements based on communal property rights have higher rates of land abandonment than settlements with private lots.

The environmental degradation associated with fire has led to government responses at multiple scales (international, national, state, regional) via policies aimed mainly at managing ignition sources. However, continued increase in forest fires suggests that these policies may be having limited impact and a fresh evaluation of current policy approaches to fire management is needed. We review fire policy measures with insights of caboclo farming practices and perspectives from Eastern Amazonia and examine the congruence between policy and practice. We demonstrate a significant disparity between policy requirements such as firebreaks and actual fire management practices, in which measures rarely meet requirements outlined in legislation. We explore the origins and the impacts of these disparities, focussing on smallholder farm-level management measures and local capacity.

By examining more microsatellites markers on more chromosomes than previous studies, we hoped to define the extent of low diversity, linkage disequilibrium, bottlenecks, population structure, and parasite migration within Brazil. We used retrospective genotyping of samples from the 1980s and 1990s to explore the population genetics of SP resistant dhfr and dhps alleles. We tested an existing hypothesis that the triple mutant dhfr mutations 50R/51I/108N and 51I/108N/164L developed in southern Amazon from a single origin of common or similar parasites. We found that Brazilian P. falciparum had limited genetic diversity and isolation by distance was rejected, which suggests it underwent bottlenecks followed by migration between sites. Unlike Peru, there appeared to be gene flow across the Brazilian Amazon basin. We were unable to divide parasite populations by clonal lineages and pairwise FST were common. Most parasite diversity was found within sites in the Brazilian Amazon, according to AMOVA. Our results challenge the hypothesis that triple mutant alleles arose from a single lineage in the Southern Amazon. SP resistance, at both the double and triple mutant stages, developed twice and potentially in different regions of the Brazilian Amazon. We would have required samples from before the 1980s to describe how SP resistance spread across the basin or describe the complex internal migration of Brazilian parasites after the colonization efforts of past decades. The Brazilian Amazon basin may have sufficient internal migration for drug resistance reported in any particular region to rapidly spread to other parts of basin under similar drug pressure.","[Griffing, Sean M.; Mixson-Hayden, Tonya; Sridaran, Sankar; Alam, Mohammad Tauqeer; de Oliveira, Alexandre Macedo; Barnwell, John W.; Udhayakumar, Venkatachalam] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Malaria Branch, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Ctr Global Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Griffing, Sean M.; Mixson-Hayden, Tonya; Alam, Mohammad Tauqeer] Atlanta Res & Educ Fdn, Decatur, GA USA; [Sridaran, Sankar] Assoc Publ Hlth Labs, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Escalante, Ananias A.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ USA",,"Udhayakumar, V (corresponding author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Malaria Branch, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Ctr Global Hlth, 4770 Buford Highway,Mail Stop F-12, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",vxu0@cdc.gov,,,,,,,15,15,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 15,2013.0,8,3,,,,,,e58984,10.1371/journal.pone.0058984,,,,,,,,WOS:000316409800050,

To map these indicators, in situ measurements of ES for 135 sampling points and remote sensing data were linked using regression methods. These methods were used to predict ES values and identify environmental factors that influence ES supply. The resulting maps help in understanding the influence of environmental factors on ES spatial distribution within the sites. The analyses illustrate the influence of land-use changes on ES supply and the role of context effects due to the heterogeneity of the biophysical environment, the temporality of deforestation and/or their diversified sociopolitical contexts.

Methods: We studied the forest dynamics (tree diameter growth, tree mortality and recruitment) of this unique forest ecosystem over a 5-year period by repeated censuses in 12 permanent plots established along a flooding gradient. Results: The cumulative basal area in the plots increased by 0.84 (+/- 0.45) m(2).ha(-1).yr(-1) (mean +/- SD) in the annually-flooded (AF) plots in lower terrain and by 0.69 (+/- 1.00) m(2).ha(-1).yr(-1) in the higher non-annually flooded (NAF) plots, corresponding to an aboveground biomass increase of 0.81 (+/- 0.57) and 0.69 (+/- 1.58) Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) in the AF and NAF plots, indicating a recent carbon sink in the biomass. Mean diameter growth rate was 1.8 (+/- 0.44) mm.yr(-1) in the AF and 2.0 (+/- 0.56) mm.yr(-1) in the NAF plots (corresponding to a coarse wood production of 1.53 (+/- 1.29) and 2.02 (+/- 0.52) Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1)), indicating no flooding effect on radial growth. Mean mortality rates in the 5-year period were 1.9 (+/- 0.37)%.yr(-1) in the AF plots and 1.8 (+/- 0.87)%.yr(-1) in the NAF plots with no differences along the flooding gradient.

Conclusions: We conclude that these drought-affected tropical floodplain forests have a lower standing biomass and aboveground productivity than central Amazonian floodplain forests in more humid climates, and the imprint of the flooding gradient on stand dynamics is relatively weak, which may result from the lower flooding height and the interaction of flooding with low nutrient supply and periodic drought.","[Homeier, Jurgen; Kurzatkowski, Dariusz; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Goettingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",,"Leuschner, C (corresponding author), Univ Goettingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@gwdg.de,,,,,,,21,21,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 3,2017.0,4,,,,,,,10,10.1186/s40663-017-0097-8,,,,,,,,WOS:000404979700001,

The beef industry declined in particular, and consequently, Russia became heavily dependent on beef imports, from Europe in the 1990s and from Brazil after 2002. Therefore, Russian demand substantially contributed to the growth of the Brazilian beef sector and fostered widespread agricultural land expansion and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The beef trade from Brazil to Russia was associated with substantial environmental costs in terms of carbon emissions and loss of biodiversity. While the abandoned agricultural land in Russia has become an important terrestrial carbon sink that would be largely diminished by re-cultivation, we argue that increasing agricultural output through re-cultivation or the expansion of grazing within Russia may be desirable from a global perspective, if the high environmental costs of production elsewhere are taken into account.","[Schierhorn, Florian; Mueller, Daniel] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Germany; [Gittelson, Alex Kramer] Int Inst Educ, New York, NY USA; [Mueller, Daniel] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Mueller, Daniel] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",,"Schierhorn, F (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Germany.",schierhorn@iamo.de,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,6,,,,,165,182,,10.1007/978-3-319-33628-2_10,10.1007/978-3-319-33628-2,,,,,,,WOS:000409534500011,

Nearly half of Amazonia is suitable for oil palm cultivation, and Malaysian corporations are now moving into the region to establish new plantations while the Brazilian government is considering a law that would count oil palm as forest towards a landowner's forest reserve requirement. Strong economic incentives for a major Amazonian oil palm industry are likely, given growing global demands for edible oils, oil-based products, and biofuel feedstocks. We have two main concerns. First, oil palm plantations are ecologically depauperate, supporting little forest-dependent wildlife. Second, we disbelieve political and corporate statements suggesting that oil palm plantations will be concentrated on previously deforested lands in Amazonia. In reality, oil palm producers strongly favor clearing primary forest for plantations because they can reap immediate profits from timber production. These profits subsidize the costs of plantation establishment and maintenance for the initial 3-5 years until the oil palm plantations become profitable. Hence, oil palm agriculture could soon emerge as a major new threat to the Amazonian environment.","[Butler, Rhett A.] Mongabay Com, Menlo Pk, CA 94026 USA; [Laurance, William F.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama",,"Butler, RA (corresponding author), Mongabay Com, POB 0291, Menlo Pk, CA 94026 USA.",laurancew@si.edu,,,,,,,108,110,,,,,,,,,,,,2009.0,2,1,,,,1,10,,10.1177/194008290900200102,,,,,,,,WOS:000208241500002,

Yet, there is little data and knowledge about fire mitigation policies' effectiveness. We experimentally assess the impact of two policies under varying drought risk scenarios among Brazilian smallholders. Command and control is more effective than payments for environmental services. We conjecture that the first policy operates through participants' risk aversion (to the fine) and local demand for justice, while payments seem to switch farmers' motivation from normative to monetary payoffs. We also find evidence of a human-mediated, self-reinforcing loop of droughts and fires: droughts increase the exogenous component of fire risk, reducing farmers' incentives to control own fires and to invest in fire-free techniques.","[Cammelli, Federico; Angelsen, Arild] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway",,"Cammelli, F (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",federico.cammelli@gmail.com; arild.angelsen@nmbu.no,,,,,,,8,10,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019.0,165.0,,,,,,,106359,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106359,,,,,,,,WOS:000487172500003,

Uncertainty in forest biomass is responsible for much of the uncertainty in current estimates of the flux of carbon from land-use change. In the present contribution several estimates of forest biomass are compared for the Brazilian Amazon, based on spatial interpolations of direct measurements, relationships to climatic variables, and remote sensing data. Three questions were posed: First, do the methods yield similar estimates? Second, do they yield similar spatial patterns of distribution of biomass? And, third, what factors need most attention if we are to predict more accurately the distribution of forest biomass over large areas? The answer to the first two questions is that estimates of biomass for Brazil's Amazonian forests (including dead and belowground biomass) vary by more than a factor of two, from a low of 39 PgC to a high of 93 PgC. Furthermore, the estimates disagree as to the regions of high and low biomass. The lack of agreement among estimates confirms the need for reliable determination of aboveground biomass over large areas. Potential methods include direct measurement of biomass through forest inventories with improved allometric regression equations, dynamic modelling of forest recovery following observed stand-replacing disturbances, and estimation of aboveground biomass from airborne or satellite-based instruments sensitive to the vertical structure plant canopies.","Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Winrock Int Livestock Res & Training Ctr, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA",,"Houghton, RA (corresponding author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, POB 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",,,,,,,,358,396,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2001.0,7.0,7,,,,731,746,,10.1046/j.1365-2486.2001.00426.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000172097300001,

The 'theory of fragmenting development' (Scholz 2002, 2004, 2005) provides helpful ideas to analyse current development processes as it explains the complementary trends of globalisation and fragmentation. However, more discussion is needed on governance mechanisms and power relations to understand the underlying processes and to assess the options different actors have at their disposal in order to influence development processes. The pivotal role of government institutions as the main drivers for development processes is increasingly being questioned in scientific debate (e.g. in the 'theory of fragmenting development'). Still, government actors in Brazil crucially influence development in the Amazon through contradicting development interventions. However, for a more realistic analysis of governance options, which should include non-governmental actors, this article suggests to analyse multi-level policy networks. The 'theory of fragmenting development' could be enriched with an analysis of actor networks and governmentality. Taking deforestation in the Amazon in the context of globalisation as an example, this article demonstrates that complex interactions between governmental and non-governmental actors on all levels, from local to global, turn policy-making into cumbersome and slow negotiation processes, but at the same time provide unprecedented opportunities to initiate development processes in line with social, economic, environmental and cultural sustainability.","FU Berlin, Inst Geog Wissensch, D-12249 Berlin, Germany",,"Segebart, D (corresponding author), FU Berlin, Inst Geog Wissensch, Malteserstr 74-100, D-12249 Berlin, Germany.",segebart@geog.fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2008.0,139.0,3,,,,187,205,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000262014700002,

Using both plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of formalization and matched samples of treated and comparison communities, we find no effect of these protections on satellite-based greenness measures.

In this paper, we implemented a method to automatically map artificial water reservoirs based on time series of Landsat images. The method was tested in the county of Sorriso (State of Mato Grosso, Brazil) where we identified 521 water reservoirs by visual inspection on very high resolution images. 68 Landsat-8 images covering 4 scenes in 2015 were pre-classified and a final class (Terrestrial or Aquatic) was determined for each pixel based on a Dempster-Shafer fusion approach. Results confirmed the potential of the methodology to automatically and efficiently detect water reservoirs in the study area (overall accuracy = 0.952 and Kappa index = 0.904) although the methodology underestimates the total area in water bodies because of the spatial resolution of Landsat images. In the case of Sorriso, we mapped 19.4 km(2) of the 20.8 km(2) of water reservoirs initially delimited by visual interpretation, i.e. we underestimated the area by 5.9%.","[Arvor, Damien; Daher, Felipe; Corpetti, Thomas; Laslier, Marianne; Dubreuil, Vincent] Univ Rennes 2, COSTEL, LETG Rennes, UMR CNRS 6554, Pl Recteur Henri Le Moal, Rennes, France",,"Arvor, D (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 2, COSTEL, LETG Rennes, UMR CNRS 6554, Pl Recteur Henri Le Moal, Rennes, France.",damien.arvor@univ-rennes2.fr,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,9998.0,,,,,,,999816,10.1117/12.2241905,,,,,,,,WOS:000393152800036,

This article sets out a framework for measuring the cost effectiveness of alternative policies-both command-and-control and incentive-based-in the Brazilian Amazon. First, I estimate the demand for deforestation on private properties, exploiting regional variation in transportation costs as a means to recover farmers' responses to permanent policies. Here, rescaling transportation costs using local yields allows me to express changes in farmers' valuations in dollars per hectare. I then use the estimated demand to infer farmers' willingness to deforest under different counterfactual policies, such as payments to avoid deforestation and taxes on land use, along with the corresponding potential farmers' lost surpluses. The results indicate that payment programmes and land use taxes on agricultural land can be highly effective in preserving the rainforest and also be substantially less expensive than command-and-control policies (approximately 8 times less costly). A carbon tax equal to the social cost of carbon could virtually eliminate all agricultural land in the Amazon, given the low agricultural returns there.","[Souza-Rodrigues, Eduardo] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Souza-Rodrigues, E (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019.0,86.0,6,,,,2713,2744,,10.1093/restud/rdy070,,,,,,,,WOS:000498169800012,

Many ecologically and biogeochemically important landscape features are spatially extensive, but occur at scales much smaller than the similar to1-km footprint of wide-swath, polar orbiting radiometers. This is especially true for land cover changes associated with human activities. Satellite instruments that offer the appropriate spatial detail have much smaller swaths and longer repeat times, resulting in compositing intervals that are too large to resolve the time scales of these changes. In addition, the cost and effort associated with acquisition and processing of high-resolution data for large areas is often prohibitive. Methods for taking advantage of information contained in multiple-scale observations by combining data from high-resolution and moderate resolution sensors are thus of great current interest. In this paper, we retrieve land cover distributions in two different parts of the Brazilian Amazon region by estimating relationships between land cover fractions derived from 30-m resolution ETM+ and reflectance data from similar to1-km resolution MODIS and MISR. The scaling relationships are derived using a Bayesian-regularized artificial neural network (ANN) and compared to results using linear unmixing (LU). We explore the simultaneous use of two significant independent variables in terrestrial optical remote sensing, wavelength, and sun-sensor geometry, by combining nadir-adjusted MODIS reflectances in seven bands (VIS-SWIR) with multiangular (-71degrees to +71degrees) bidirectional reflectance data from MISR. This research was motivated by evidence from modeling and field studies demonstrating that: (a) the angular dependence of reflectance (e.g., from MISR) contains information about the structural composition of canopies that is complementary to the wavelength dependence; and (b) the SWIR portion of the spectrum (e.g., from MODIS) is sensitive to canopy moisture and shading conditions and, therefore, to the successional status of the ecosystem. This case study, using the Bayesian artificial neural network with combined MODIS-MISR data to estimate sub-pixel land cover fractions, yielded a quantitative improvement over spectral linear unmixing of single-angle, multispectral data.

Yet, the relationship between fire and deforestation may vary temporally and spatially depending on the type of deforestation and climatic conditions. This study evaluates spatiotemporal dynamics of deforestation and fire represented by burned area over the 2002-2012 period in the Brazilian Legal Amazon. As a first step, we compared newly available Landsat-based maps of gross forest cover loss from the Global Forest Change (GFC) project with maps of deforestation extent from the Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project (PRODES) produced by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). As a second step, we rescaled the Landsat-based data to the 500m resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area data (MCD64A1) and stratified this using MODIS land cover data to study the role of burned area in forest cover loss and deforestation. We found that while GFC forest cover loss and PRODES deforestation generally agreed on spatial and temporal dynamics, there were several key differences between the data sets. Both showed a decrease in the extent of forest cover loss or deforestation after 2004, but the drop was larger and more continuous in PRODES than in GFC. The observed decrease in forest cover loss or deforestation rates over our study period was mainly due to lower clearing rates in the evergreen broadleaf forests in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rondonia. GFC indicated anomalously high forest cover loss in the years 2007 and 2010, which was not reported by PRODES. The burned area data indicated that this was predominantly related to increased burned area occurring outside of the tropical forest area during these dry years, mainly in Para. This indicated that fire and forest loss dynamics in woodlands or secondary forests may be equally important as deforestation in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In addition to the decrease in forest cover loss rates, we also found that post-deforestation fire use declined; burned area within 5 years after forest cover loss decreased from 54 to 39% during our study period.","[Fanin, T.; van der Werf, G.

I investigate how rural agricultural households displaced by the Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian Amazon used ties to family and close friends in both the origin and destination during the course of migration, from pre-migration planning through post-migration livelihood reconstruction. I discover that the majority of households made strategic use of strong ties, relying on local and translocal social capital to help them find and purchase new property. Also, numerous households migrated to the same destinations as other displaced households and/or to places where family and friends had already lived beforehand. Maintaining strong ties in the destination was a priority for many households, as it facilitated the process of rebuilding livelihoods by providing social, financial, and emotional support. This study sheds light on how households make use of social networks during environmental migration, which can in turn help us better understand how social ties may shape migration decisions, capabilities, and destination choices among those displaced due to future environmental change.","[Randell, Heather] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,"Randell, H (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",hrandell@umd.edu,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,WIN,2018.0,4.0,4,,,,394,416,,10.1525/sod.2018.4.4.394,,,,,,,,WOS:000517983700004,

Yet in many areas of the developing world where AFS have proven their agronomic potential, they have yet to be widely adopted. This paper approaches the issue with a focus on one such area - the western Brazilian Amazon, an area where economic integration within the region itself, across national boundaries, and between the region and the rest of Brazil ('regional integration') may soon vastly shift incentives to natural resource users. The paper addresses AFS adoption via a conceptual framework that argues for scrutinizing agronomic and socioeconomic characteristics of AFS and their potential adopters. This framework facilitates a priori assessment of whether specific AFS will be adopted, and if so, by whom and with what likely impact on the development objectives at hand. It highlights characteristics that lend socioeconomic and agronomic 'agility' - connoting flexibility to easily shift production systems and accompanying marketing strategies in response to unforeseen or rapid change (due to qualities of the AFS itself, or the producer). Financial performance indicators (net present value of AFS during establishment and for the life of a project, and years to positive cash flow) are presented for selected AFS, and juxtaposed to a livestock production system that is already gaining wide adoption in the area. This juxtaposition illustrates the practical effects of socioeconomic and agronomic characteristics posited as influential. Against this backdrop, trends in 'regional integration' are discussed, along with implications this integration process has for AFS adoption. The paper ends with a discussion of the roles and limitations of policy in promoting AFS adoption.","Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,"Vosti, SA (corresponding author), Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,,1997.0,38.0,1-3,,,,195,222,,10.1023/A:1005921917359,,,,,,,,WOS:000072684700010,

I also addressed the historical importance of the central Brazilian forests in connecting Amazon and Atlantic Forest populations of rodents and marsupials. Methods I evaluated variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to estimate the levels of sequence divergence between those taxa occurring throughout the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and forests in the Cerrado and Caatinga regions. I inferred the hierarchical relationships between haplotypes, populations and formal taxa using the cladistic approach of maximum parsimony. I compared areas and the clades identified by superimposing cladograms on the geographical distribution of samples. The degree of concordance both in phylogeny and the depth of the nodes in these phylogenies, in addition to patterns of geographical distribution of clades, permitted me to make inferences on how, when and where the taxa differentiated. Results Sequence similarity is often greater between samples from the Atlantic Forest and either Amazon or central Brazilian forests than it is within each of the two rain forest domains. The Atlantic Forest clades are either not reciprocally monophyletic or are the sister group to all the other clades. There is some indication of northern and southern components in the Atlantic Forest. Given the geographical distribution of clades and the relatively deep levels of divergence, the central Brazilian area does not behave as a separate region but is complementary to either Amazon or Atlantic Forest. Patterns of area relationships differ across taxa, suggesting that different processes and/or historic events affected the diversification within each lineage. Main conclusions The Amazon and the Atlantic forests are not exclusive in terms of their small mammal faunas; both overlap broadly with taxa occurring in gallery forests and dry forests in central Brazil. Central Brazilian forests are an integral part of the evolutionary scenario of lowland small mammals, playing an important role as present and past habitats for rain forest species. Therefore, representatives from this area should always be included in analyses of the evolutionary history of lowland rain forest faunas. The incongruence of branching patterns among areas is in agreement with recent results presented for Neotropical passerine birds and indicates that a single hypothesis of Neotropical area relationships is unlikely. These findings reinforce the idea that speciation in the Neotropics will not be explained by any single model of vicariance or climatic changes.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Costa, LP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31260901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",leonora@icb.ufmg.br,,,,,,,400,434,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2003.0,30.0,1,,,,71,86,,10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00792.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000180394900006,

Drawing from long-term research among the Kaiabi (Tupi-Guarani) indigenous people, we compare the process of formation of indigenous leaders and indigenous. political organizations among three Kaiabi groups-Xingu, Teles Pires, and Rio dos Peixes-following the relocation of the majority of Kaiabi to Xingu Park starting in the 1960s. New models of leadership emerging from interaction with other indigenous groups-from the history of the creation of Xingu Park in Brazil and from access to resources brought by the alliance between indigenous peoples and environmentalism-were important factors enabling political empowerment among the displaced Xingu Kaiabi in contrast with the other two groups. We discuss contradictions of political empowerment and strengthening of indigenous organizations in the Amazon, which may also lead to trade-offs and to the risk of dependence on outside funds and agents.

The assessment is guided by an analytical framework that predicts the relevance and receptiveness of different timber supply chains to current systems of trade-based governance. We find that Brazil's efforts to control illegal deforestation through satellite monitoring have contributed significantly to reducing deforestation, but the effects on degradation are less clear. Efforts focused on the timber supply chain, including certification and legal verification of traded timber, have been limited by the fragmented nature of Amazonian wood production. Both certification and legality verification favor large producers and concentrated supply chains destined for external markets (e.g. pulp and paper and high-value tropical sawnwood), while extensive legal requirements inhibit local benefit-capture. In order to prevent the means of forest governance (i.e. certification and law enforcement) from trumping its commonly stated ends (sustainable forest management and local welfare), there is a need to prioritize the generation of local benefit from locally adapted production systems.

Specifically, this paper examines the relationship between a woman's age and her use and knowledge of medicinal plants. It also examines whether length of residence in three different areas of the Amazon is correlated with a woman's use and knowledge of medicinal plants. Two of the areas where respondents may have resided, the jungle/seringal and farms/colonias, are classified as rural. The third area (which all of the respondents resided in) was urban. Methods: This paper utilizes survey data collected in Rio Branco, Brazil. Researchers administered the survey to 153 households in the community of Bairro da Luz (a pseudonym). The survey collected data on phytotherapeutic knowledge, general phytotherapeutic practice, recent phytotherapeutic practice and demographic information on age and length of residence in the seringal, on a colonia, and in a city. Bivariate correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the inter-relationships among the key variables. Three dependent variables, two measuring general phytotherapeutic practice and one measuring phytotherapeutic knowledge were regressed on the demographic factors. Results: The results demonstrate a relationship between a woman's age and medicinal plant use, but not between age and plant knowledge. Additionally, length of residence in an urban area and on a colonia/farm are not related to medicinal plant knowledge or use. However, length of residence in the seringal/jungle is positively correlated with both medicinal plant knowledge and use. Conclusions: The results reveal a vibrant tradition of medicinal plant use in Bairro da Luz. They also indicate that when it comes to place of residence and phytotherapy the meaningful distinction is not rural versus urban, it is seringal versus other locations. Finally, the results suggest that phytotherapeutic knowledge and use should be measured separately since one may not be an accurate proxy for the other.","[Wayland, Coral] Univ N Carolina, Dept Anthropol, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Walker, Lisa Slattery] Univ N Carolina, Dept Sociol, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",,"Wayland, C (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Anthropol, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",cwayland@uncc.edu,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 24,2014.0,10.0,,,,,,,25,10.1186/1746-4269-10-25,,,,,,,,WOS:000336067700001,

Here we assess if restriction of land clearing within Amazonian PAs displaces deforestation pressure to adjacent forests, a spillover effect called leakage, or if it further inhibits deforestation around PAs, a spillover effect called blockage. Leakage can undermine the net impact achieved by PA establishment. We calculated the non-target and target impacts of 91 state-governed (non-indigenous) PAs established between 2005 and 2016 on satellite monitored deforestation rates. We then assessed how well the features of PM, like size and restriction level, explain the spillovers. On average, 2% or less of the assessed spillover zone was deforested more extensively (leakage) or less extensively (blockage) than the area expected to have been deforested without nearby PA establishment. Blockages outnumbered leakages regardless of the method adopted to calculate the deforestation baseline rate. Our results suggest the establishment of PM has inhibited deforestation both within their boundaries and in their adjacent surroundings. The 17 PAs that did not inhibit deforestation within their boundaries and the 19 PAs where leakage occurred were geographically concentrated in southern and western protected regions of Amazonia Legal. High-magnitude leakage of deforestation pressure from PM to their adjacent surroundings seems therefore to be rare in the Brazilian Amazon. For the most effective conservation of Amazonian forests, priority should be given to achieving additionality with any new PA and ensuring the permanence and enforcement of those already established.","[Fuller, Carley; Ondei, Stefania; Brook, Barry W.; Buettel, Jessie C.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Brook, Barry W.; Buettel, Jessie C.] ARC Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritag, Hobart, Tas, Australia",,"Fuller, C (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",carley.fuller@utas.edu.au,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020.0,248.0,,,,,,,108673,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108673,,,,,,,,WOS:000556843900032,

A combination of the explanatory richness of political ecology with the methodological rigor of land change science greatly enhances our understanding of land change processes.","[Aldrich, Stephen] Indiana State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Syst, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Walker, Robert; Simmons, Cynthia] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Caldas, Marcellus] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Perz, Stephen] Univ Florida, Dept Sociol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Aldrich, S (corresponding author), Indiana State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Syst, 159 Sci Bldg, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",steve.aldrich@indstate.edu; rwalker@msu.edu; simm0108@msu.edu; caldasma@k-state.edu; sperz@ufl.edu,,,,,,,69,70,,,,,,,,,,,,2012.0,102.0,1,,,,103,128,,10.1080/00045608.2011.620501,,,,,,,,WOS:000301651900006,

The approach is implemented using 82 streamflow gauging locations in the Amazon Basin. Using the estimated values for the hydraulic geometry relations, bankfull discharge, discharge data above bankfull and upstream drainage area at each site, relationships for estimating channel and floodplain characteristics as a function of drainage area are developed. Specifically, this research provides relationships for estimating bankfull discharge, bankfull depth, bankfull width, and floodplain width as a function of upstream drainage area in the Amazon Basin intended for providing reasonable cross-section estimates for large scale hydraulic routing models. The derived relationships are also combined with a high resolution drainage network to develop relationships for estimating cumulative upstream channel lengths and surface areas as a function of the specified minimum channel width ranging from 2m to 1 km (i.e. threshold drainage areas ranging from 1 to 431,000 km(2)). At the finest resolution (i.e. all channels greater than 2m or a threshold area of 1 km(2)), the Amazon Basin contains approximately 4.4 million kilometers of channels with a combined surface area of 59,700 km(2). The intended use of these relationships is for partitioning total floodable area (channels versus lakes and floodplain lakes) obtained from remote sensing for biogeochemical applications (e.g. quantifying CO2 evasion in the Amazon Basin).

However, the timing of the introduction of the disease in the Americas is still a matter of controversy. In this paper we appraise the debate in the context of the Brazilian Amazon, where malaria is, at the present time and has been for several centuries, an important health problem. We review and summarize the available evidence in favor of the introduction of malaria after the conquest based on historical documents, studies in genetics and evolutionary biology, epidemiological issues, and archaeological discoveries. We argue that despite the compelling arguments provided by the extant body of evidence, a more definitive proof is needed. We suggest that archaeology, via analyses of existing skeletal remains from Amazonia using biomolecular techniques, may represent the best (and unique) approach to a definitive resolution of a long-standing debate. We anticipate that in the near future a multidisciplinary effort can be brought together to provide a clear answer to a long standing epidemiological question: Was malaria present in the Amazon before the European conquest?

Yet little is known about the biomass, C, nutrient pools, or their responses to the frequent fires occurring in these pastures. We sampled biomass, nutrient pools and their losses or transformation during fire in three Amazonian cattle pastures with typical, but different, land-use histories. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) ranged from to 53 to 119 Mg ha(-1). Residual wood debris from the forests that formally occupied the sites composed the majority of TAGB (47-87%). Biomass of fine fuels, principally pasture grasses, was approximate to 16-29 Mg ha(-1). Grasses contained as much as 52% of the aboveground K pool and the grass and litter components combined composed as much as 88% of the aboveground P pool. Fires consumed 21-84% of the TAGB. Losses of C to the atmosphere ranged from 11 to 21 Mg ha(-1) and N losses ranged from 205 to 261 kg ha(-1). Losses of S, P, Ca, and K were < 33 kg ha(-1). There were no changes in surface soil (0-10 cm) nutrient concentration in pastures compared to adjacent primary forests. Fires occur frequently in cattle pastures (i.e., about every 2 years) and pastures are now likely the most common type of land burned in Amazonia. The first 6 years of a pastures existence would likely include the primary forest slash fire and three pasture fires. Based upon our results, the cumulative losses of N from these fires would be 1935 kg ha(-1) (equivalent to 94% of the aboveground pool of primary forest). Postfire aboveground C pools in old pastures are as low as 3% of those in adjacent primary forest. The initial primary forest slash fire and the repeated fires occurring in the pastures result in the majority of aboveground C and nutrient pools being released via combustion processes rather than decomposition processes.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; USDA, Forest Serv, Intermt Res Stn, Missoula, MT 59807 USA",,"Kauffman, JB (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",kauffman@ccmail.orst.edu,,,,,,,112,118,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,1998.0,113.0,3,,,,415,427,,10.1007/s004420050394,,,,,,,,WOS:000071964600014,

We characterize the chemical and isotopic variability of river sediments of the Amazon Basin, collected at different water depths, as a function of grain size. Absolute chemical concentrations and Sr and Nd isotopic ratios greatly varies along channel depth. The Al/Si ratio, tightly linked to grain size distribution, systematically decreases with depth, mostly reflecting dilution by quartz minerals. A double-normalization diagram is proposed to correct from dilution effects. Elements define fan-shaped patterns and can be classified in three different groups with respect to hydrodynamic sorting during transport in the Amazon: (1) poorly sorted insoluble elements like Al, Fe, Th, and REEs, (2) well-sorted insoluble elements like Zr and Ti, mainly carried by heavy minerals, and (3) alkali (Na to Cs) and alkali-earth elements (Mg to Ba), for which a large variety of patterns is observed, related, for alkali, to their variable affinity for phyllosilicates. Sr isotopes show that the Amazon River at the mouth is stratified, the Madeira- and Solimoes-derived sediments being preferentially transported near the channel surface and at depth, respectively.

Among the most prominent of these policies is the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an agreement by grain traders not to purchase soy grown on recently deforested land. The ASM inspired widespread adoption of similar zero-deforestation commitments, but its impact is poorly understood due to its overlap with other conservation policies. Here, we apply an econometric triple-differences model to remotely sensed deforestation data to isolate the ASM's impact within Brazil's Arc of Deforestation. We show that the ASM reduced deforestation in soy-suitable locations in the Amazon by 0.66 +/- 0.32 percentage points relative to a counterfactual control, preventing 18,000 +/- 9,000 km(2) of deforestation over its first decade (2006-2016). Although these results highlight potential benefits of private conservation policies, the ASM's success was dependent on complementarities with public property registries and deforestation monitoring. Disentangling the impacts of anti-deforestation interventions from other conservation efforts remains a challenge. An econometric analysis of remotely sensed data reveals the efficacy of the Soy Moratorium in the Brazilian Arc of Deforestation and the extent to which its success relies on complementary policies.","[Heilmayr, Robert] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Environm Studies Program, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Heilmayr, Robert] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rausch, Lisa L.; Munger, Jacob; Gibbs, Holly K.] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm SAGE, Madison, WI USA; [Gibbs, Holly K.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Heilmayr, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Environm Studies Program, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.; Heilmayr, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",rheilmayr@ucsb.edu,,,,,,,18,18,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020.0,1.0,12,,,,801,810,,10.1038/s43016-020-00194-5,,,,,,,,WOS:000599803800014,

Very few Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) include runoff which brings a specific contribution to the Ocean physics. Comparison of simulations with constant or monthly runoffs shows that the spread of the Amazon fresh waters offshore of the north Brazilian coast id controlled by the ocean circulation and not by the Amazon flow. Therefore, in the model like in the observations, SSS minimum is observed in summer three months after the Amazon flood. In agreement with observations, a thick (more than 40 m) Barrier Layer (BL) is present every summer north of the Amazon mouth. Because of the strong and shallow salinity gradient associated with the Amazon freshwater, an important part of the solar radiation is trapped in the BL and creates an inversion of the vertical gradient of temperature. However with this forced model, BL does not seem to have a clear impact on SST and so on the air-sea interaction. Freshwater flux is also able to bend the sea surface.

Furthermore, the potential deforestation risk zones were identified using the Maximum Entropy based predictive modelling. Outcome showed that the forest cover losses within the PAs were 114,463 ha and 782,781 ha within the buffer zones in the last 20 years. Additionally, high deforestation risk zones were mainly found in the central and southwestern parts of the Peruvian Amazon and interestingly close to the navigable riverbanks.

A spatially explicit analysis along the Transamazon Highway in Brazil,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Understanding actor-specific responsibility for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is key in adjusting policy and resource allocation in the face of current forest destruction. However, previous research shows that there is great variability in such assessments. To contribute to the ongoing discussions on forest conservation and rural development policies in the Amazon, this paper studies actor-specific deforestation and its environmental effects in four municipalities situated along the Transamazon Highway. We used spatially explicit methods that integrate a database of 8281 georeferenced properties with a time series of remote-sensing data covering four periods between 1986 and 2007. We also included landscape ecology metrics as improved indicators of the complex environmental effects of forest fragmentation. The analysis demonstrates that smallholders (defined as colonists who own less than 100 ha of land) were responsible for 23% of total deforestation in the study region while accounting for 55% of the total properties. We also explored the relationship between property size and deforestation at the property level, finding that it closely follows a power distribution. Property deforestation increased with property size, while the percentage of property deforestation decreased. In spite of this, compliance with current legal requirements to maintain 50% of property forest cover was not statistically different between smallholders and largeholders. In comparison to municipalities dominated by medium- and large-scale ranchers, the smallholder-dominated municipality of Medicilandia showed better performance in all applied landscape metrics with well-established relationships with the provision of important environmental goods and services. Although all studied municipalities showed severe accumulated deforestation, Medicilandia experienced an abrupt decrease in municipal deforestation after 1999 to just 0.03% year(-1), while municipalities dominated by larger holders maintained or increased their previous deforestation rates to between 0.90% and 1.34% year(-1) in the same period. This indicates that the smallholders' productions schemes in our study area might present potential for agricultural frontier stabilization based on improved land-use efficiency. The policy implications of our findings are discussed, especially with regard to the role of smallholders in productive forest conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Following an historical account of the geopolitical motivations for the evolving legislation, political action, and program and project implementation decisions that impacted the Brazilian Amazon, I trace the specific interventions that caused the garimpeiros to then shift across the border to Guyana, and outline the environmental and social impacts this migration is having upon the places and the peoples of the Rupununi. I conclude by suggesting that the Rupununi is unknowingly enmeshed within the larger geopolitical concerns of the region, and that the migration of Brazilian miners from across the border may be signalling the advent of a larger geopolitical concern: that of the integrity of the Rupununi as a Guyanese territory.

Substantial shifts in the concentration and composition of recently deposited sedimentary OM suggest that intensive deforestation over the last few decades has considerably modified the natural inputs of sedimentary materials to the aquatic ecosystems by disrupting the terrigenous fluxes of humus and soil materials from the drainage basin. The observed compositional changes of bulk OM and land derived biomarkers (e.g. lignin) in recent sediments illustrate a sedimentary enrichment in OM from soil horizons that, under normal forest cover, tend to be retained in the drainage basin. On average, the recently accumulated OM is nitrogen-rich ((C/N)a = 12-15) and more highly degraded ((Ac/Al)v = 0.4-0.6 and DHBA/V = 0.15-0.20) than deep materials ((C/N)a = 20-30, (Ac/Al)v = 0.25-0.4, and DHBA/V = 0.05-0.10), showing that this recently accumulated material is more humified than original inputs to the aquatic system, and consistent with increased exportation of fine eroded mineral and organic particles from surface soils along river banks. The present study illustrates the relevance of using OM oxidation products in sediment profiles to evaluate deforestation impacts on aquatic ecosystems and to characterize the nature of eroded soil materials, complementing studies on mineral/metal cycling.

Unlike for the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, there are no standard indices for quantifying this gradient. Here we describe a method for identifying the SST gradient that is most closely associated with June-August precipitation over the south Amazon. We use an ensemble of atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) integrations forced by observed SST from 1949 to 2005. A large number of tropical Atlantic SST gradient indices are generated randomly and temporal correlations are examined between these indices and June-August precipitation averaged over the Amazon Basin south of the equator. The indices correlating most strongly with June-August southern Amazon precipitation form a cluster of near-meridional orientation centred near the equator. The location of the southern component of the gradient is particularly well defined in a region off the Brazilian tropical coast, consistent with known physical mechanisms. The chosen index appears to capture much of the Atlantic SST influence on simulated southern Amazon dry-season precipitation, and is significantly correlated with observed southern Amazon precipitation. We examine the index in 36 different coupled atmosphere-ocean model projections of climate change under a simple compound 1% increase in CO2. Within the large spread of responses, we find a relationship between the projected trend in the index and the Amazon dry-season precipitation trends. Furthermore, the magnitude of the trend relationship is consistent with the inter-annual variability relationship found in the AGCM simulations. This suggests that the index would be of use in quantifying uncertainties in climate change in the region.","[Good, Peter; Lowe, Jason A.; Collins, Mat; Moufouma-Okia, Wilfran] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",,"Good, P (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",peter.good@metoffice.gov.uk,,,,,,,46,46,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 27,2008.0,363.0,1498,,,,1761,1766,,10.1098/rstb.2007.0024,,,,,,,,WOS:000254577500006,

Deforestation from slash-and-burn agricultural activities has dramatically decreased the amount of primary growth upland and flooded forests in the basin. The increasing area that is converted to agricultural plots and pasture in the Lake Calado basin has increased solute loading to the lake from upland tributaries (storm and base flow), bank seepage and overland flow, and decreased throughfall inputs. Whereas solute concentrations in stream water were generally higher in 1992 than 1930, Na+ and Cl- concentrations were also considerably higher in 2001 than 1992, likely because of an increase in the number of humans and cattle in the watershed. Estimates of solute inputs to Lake Calado via throughfall indicate that the mass transfer of some major solutes in the throughfall of undisturbed flooded forests can be larger than that from a combination of all other sources in areas that do not have a strong influence from the Solimoes River. Chemical gains in rain as it passed through the forest canopy occurred for most major ions and relatively large gains were observed for PO43- and Ca2+.

However, only few researches are led to analyse the way they emerge, except for criticising top-down governmental choices. Yet, the historical approach and strategic analysis of public policy building over the long term allows a better understanding of the stakes of action capacity of these policies. We therefore mobilize the advocacy coalition framework to show that protected areas creation is always due to coalitions of actors who belong to different professional fields and act at different scales but nevertheless share common stakes. On the basis of a comparative study in French and Brazilian Amazon, we show that if all coalitions for protected areas share a common objective of limited deforestation, they are still very different according to the type of conservation they promote (strict biodiversity conservation, population-based conservation or sustainable forest management). We also show that the ability of the coalitions to build efficient public policies is highly depending on internal factors (i.e. their ability to gather strategic resources) and on external factors (i.e. socio-political context and international pressure). Finally, the comparative analysis of coalitions pleading for the same type of protected areas in two different countries allows us to insist on the importance of qualitative embedded researches when it comes to understand why some protected areas have more chances to reach environmental effectiveness in one socio-political context than in another one.

With a variety of historical sources this study traces the history of landscape change in Amazonian communities that have existed since the early 1900's, in a region comprising both upland and riverine ecosystems. Aerial photography from 1948, 1965 and 1977 and satellite images from 1993 to 2005 are analyzed to reconstruct spatial transformations of the study region. The reconstructed landscape history is analyzed as a result of shifts in economy, policy, local markets and river dynamics. In 1948, the upland region was used for agriculture and farms appeared to be encroaching into primary forest. However by 1965, 49% of the upland farm area had become secondary forest, as farmers left upland farms fallow and moved into the floodplain to farm crops promoted through agricultural credit programs. Between 1965 and 1977 river channel migration affected the riverine landscape, dramatic floods occurred throughout the Amazon River and many farmers migrated to the city. During the 1980's the credit given to small farmers greatly increased, resulting in the highest density of farms in the landscape by 1993. The disappearance of these credits is reflected in reduced farming activity and increased charcoal production.

The dynamics of SF in slash-and-burn fanning were studied by investigating changes in the role of SF with frontier development. Farm survey data from a colonist settlement area in the Peruvian Amazon were analyzed by using a recursive econometric model. Results confirmed that substantial areas of SF exist on slash-and-burn farms during the first few decades after settlement. As a result, over a third of the farm area is under forest cover. This implies that deforestation in slash-and-burn fanning may be less than previously believed. Soil recuperation is the most important reason for the existence of SF in slash-and-burn agriculture. During the relatively early stages of frontier development studied in this paper, fallow periods increased over time as site productivity declined, giving rise to secondary forests. Pastures lowered forested areas on farms and appear to impede the regeneration of SE Commercial exploitation of SF products was minimal and declines with frontier development, The conclusions show that improved short-rotation fallows may recuperate the soil at the expense of forest cover, particularly in areas where most of the forest cover consists of SE This conflict could be resolved by technologies that enrich SF and reinforce its multiple functions, including soil recuperation, Reduction of extensive cattle ranching may be a more effective way to conserve forest cover in slash-and-burn farming than technologies for shortening fallow periods. A 'quantum leap' in the benefits of forested land will be required if increases in forest cover are to be compatible with farmer welfare. This is likely to require innovative approaches, such as commercialization of the environmental services of forests. The results of this research could potentially shift efforts to control deforestation away from slash-and-burn farmers, thus reducing the perceived conflict between forest conservation and the livelihood of poor people.

However, such estimates have been questioned because of the poor spatial representation of the sampling plots and the incomplete understanding of purported mechanisms behind the increases in biomass. Ecosystem models, when used in conjunction with satellite data, are useful in examining the carbon budgets in regions where the observations of carbon flows are sparse. The purpose of this study is to explain observed trends in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using climate observations and ecosystem models of varying complexity in the western Amazon basin for the period of 1984-2002. We first investigated trends in NDVI and found a positive trend during the study period, but the positive trend in NDVI was observed only in the months from August to December. Then, trends in various climate parameters were calculated, and of the climate variables considered, only shortwave radiation was found to have a corresponding significant positive trend. To compare the impact of each climate component, as well as increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, on evergreen forests in the Amazon, we ran three ecosystem models (CASA, Biome-BGC, and LPJ), and calculated monthly net primary production by changing a climate component selected from the available climate datasets. As expected, CO2 fertilization effects showed positive trends throughout the year and cannot explain the positive trend in NDVI, which was observed only for the months of August to December. Through these simulations, we demonstrated that the positive trend in shortwave radiation can explain the positive trend in NDVI observed for the period from August to December. We conclude that the positive trend in shortwave radiation is the most likely driver of the increasing trend in NDVI and the corresponding observed increases in forest biomass.","[Hashimoto, Hirofumi; Melton, Forrest; Milesi, Cristina; Wang, Weile] Calif State Univ, Seaside, CA 93955 USA; [Hashimoto, Hirofumi; Melton, Forrest; Milesi, Cristina; Wang, Weile; Nemani, Ramakrishna R.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Ichii, Kazuhito] Fukushima Univ, Fac Symbiot Syst Sci, Fukushima, Japan",,"Hashimoto, H (corresponding author), Calif State Univ, Seaside, CA 93955 USA.",hirofumi.hashimoto@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,16,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2010.0,16.0,1,,,,255,271,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01921.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000274419200021,

Market globalization and trade liberalization policies reinforce this trend and risk deforestation to be embedded in global value chains. Due to the complexity of global production and trade systems, deforestation risk is also embedded in the supply chains of the products and sectors that are not direct deforestation drivers. Bovine leather is a commodity closely entangled in the debates about deforestation as it is a by-product of cattle. This research focuses on leather trade between Brazil and Italy to demonstrate the channels through which Italian imports of Brazilian leather could possess embedded Amazonian deforestation and related risks. The data employed for the analysis was searched at three different levels for the leather trade between Brazil and Italy: (a) the country level annual leather trade statistics for the years 2014-2018 taken from the Comtrade database; (b) the state level leather trade data, for the years 2014-2018 taken from the Comexstat database; and (c) the exporter-importer level leather trade data for the period of August 2017-August 2018, based on customs declarations. The analysis helps to demonstrate that the Italian leather trade with Brazil possesses the risk of deforestation unless the proper traceability and due diligence systems are in place to claim the opposite. The European and Italian leather industry need to be more proactive in acknowledging the existence of the risk at different levels, putting full traceability systems in place and sending out clear market signals that deforestation is not tolerated, and that sustainability is valued.","[Mammadova, Aynur; Masiero, Mauro; Pettenella, Davide] Univ Padua, TESAF Dept, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy",,"Mammadova, A (corresponding author), Univ Padua, TESAF Dept, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",aynur.mammadova@phd.unipd.it; mauro.masiero@unipd.it; davide.pettenella@unipd.it,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2020.0,11.0,4,,,,,,472,10.3390/f11040472,,,,,,,,WOS:000534632500110,

The challenge, therefore, lies in implementing projects that achieve national or regional development goals while also generating positive social and economic outcomes for displaced populations. This paper uses a longitudinal, mixed-methods design to understand the short-term changes in wealth and subjective well-being of households displaced due to construction of the Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian Amazon. The households were compensated by either cash or credit for their lost land and assets, and were then responsible for finding and purchasing new property. Using pre- and post-displacement household survey and semi-structured interview data, as well as data from a small comparison group, I find that wealth increased for the majority of the study population and that socioeconomic inequality decreased, as poorer households experienced greater improvements in housing conditions, assets, and property ownership. In addition, subjective well-being improved for most households, particularly among those who did not own land at baseline, those who gained assets such as vehicles, those who remained closer to the original study area, and those who remained in close proximity to other households from the study population. Moving to an urban destination was strongly associated with declines in well-being, as was moving far from family or friends. These results suggest that investing sufficient resources in a compensation-based resettlement program can benefit households displaced by large infrastructure projects in the short term, but additional data collection is needed after the completion of dam construction to determine whether these benefits are sustained over the longer term.

However, given their mixed effectiveness, we want to know when they have impacts internally and, if they do, when they have spillovers. Political economy posits roles for the level of government. One hypothesis is that federal PAs avoid more internal deforestation than state PAs since federal agencies consider gains for other jurisdictions. Such political differences as well as economic mechanisms can cause PA spillovers to vary greatly, even from leakage, more deforestation elsewhere, to blockage, less deforestation elsewhere. We examine internal impacts and local spillovers for Brazilian Amazon federal and state agencies. Outside the region's arc of deforestation, we confirm little internal impact and show no spillovers. In the arc, we test impacts by state, as states are large and feature considerably different dynamics. For internal impacts, estimates for federal PAs and indigenous lands are higher than for state PAs. For local spillover impacts, estimates for most arc states either are not significant or are not robust; however, for Para, federal PAs and indigenous lands feature both internal impacts and local spillovers. Yet, the spillovers in Para go in opposite directions across agencies, leakage for indigenous lands but blockage for federal PAs, suggesting a stronger external signal from the environmental agency. Across all these tools, only federal PAs lower deforestation internally and nearby.

Although the region shows recent increases in disturbance and deforestation rates and leakage into forests surrounding concession areas, land-use policy and remoteness are serving to protect the Peruvian Amazon.","Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Anthropol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Inst Bien Comun, Lima 18, Peru; Boston Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,"Asner, GP (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gpa@stanford.edu,,,,,,,232,244,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 31,2007.0,317.0,5842,,,,1233,1236,,10.1126/science.1146324,,,,,,,,WOS:000249126800044,

Even if there are commonalties between Brazil and Peru, major differences are identified. Road access to the frontier is much greater in Brazil, linking the forest to the rest of the country; most of the Brazilian farmers have gained legal title through colonization projects or by claiming land after clearing.

Dissolved compounds partially result from water-rock interactions, which produce a large range of water chemical and isotopic compositions. These waters are collected by rivers, that are commonly assumed to be well-mixed with regard to their different tributaries, as a result of turbulent dispersion. In this paper, we test this hypothesis on the Solimoes River (at Manacapuru), the largest tributary of the Amazon River, by analyzing the sodium concentration and strontium isotopic composition of river water on a transverse section at different depths. High-precision measurements reveal lateral heterogeneities. This reflects poor mixing between two main river masses, that have distinct chemical and isotopic signatures, a hundred kilometers downstream from their confluence: the Solimoes mainstream and the Purus River. Using sodium concentration data, the transverse dispersion coefficient is estimated for the studied Solimbes reach (the Earth's largest river on which such an estimate now exists), and is found to be 1.8 +/- 0.2 m(2)/s. Comparison with previously reported data highlights the potential role of bed morphology and islands in the efficiency of lateral mixing in large rivers. We finally demonstrate that the characteristic length of lateral mixing downstream from confluences in large rivers is at least of several tens of kilometers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The road crosses lands that are remarkably heterogeneous in terms of ecological conditions, comprising distinctive soil types from extremely poor to relatively fertile. Although this reality contributes to the land use potential and human carrying capacity of each place, deforestation of road margins appears equally intensive on all types of land. In the mid-1990s, two dead-end roads starting from both urban centres were characterized by distinctive zones of resource exploitation, with a road-free section of primary forest in between. A few years later, the separate road ends were linked by a dirt road that served only occasional traffic, but introduced significant new settlement. Various developmental trends evidence incoherent resource management and momentary public support in the region. By promoting diverse economic activities that reflect environmental conditions in the initial land use planning and land allocation, most sections along this road could be considered economically valuable for purposes such as sustainable forestry, tourism, agroforestry and, in suitable sites, intensive agriculture. To promote the more sustainable uses, thorough environmental legislation, administrative guidelines and follow-up based on an implicit mechanism of learning from previous experiences should be implemented. At the local level, there are some important initiatives to support such development, including ecological and economic zoning.

We examined patterns of ecosystem diversity, deforestation and fragmentation and provided an estimate on their possible causes through a temporal and spatial analysis of biotic and abiotic data using remote sensing and geographical information systems in six pilot areas covering a total of 4,200,000 ha. Ecological, demographic and socio-economic data were analysed to establish the local conditions. We used a landscape ecology approach to calculate indicators of ecosystem diversity, cover and forest fragmentation such as number of patches, mean patch size, mean shape index and mean nearest neighbour distance. Patterns of deforestation did not run parallel to access roads; instead the typical pattern of unplanned colonization follows the only transportation network existing in many areas in the Colombian Amazonia: rivers. In addition, we have used indicators of human influence such as demographic pressure, quality of life and economic activity indicators. Results show that the extent and rate of change varies between areas depending on population density. Annual deforestation rates were 3.73 and 0.97% in the high population density growth areas of Alto Putumayo and Macarena respectively, and 0.31, 0.23, and 0.01% in the relatively unpopulated areas of indigenous population. These changes are related to land use history as well as to environmental and historical socio-economic factors such as oil extraction, deforestation, cattle ranching or illegal cropping. The current situation in the region suggests that tropical deforestation rates in the Colombian Amazon are substantially higher than those found in previous studies in the rest of the Amazon.

This is a cross-sectional approach, which allows comparisons in terms of avoided deforestation among the different types of protection in the same period. This study covers three different periods. Regions protected de jure were sampled by estimating a threshold distance at which deforestation starts to diminish and retaining all pixels up to that distance, and deforestation that has been avoided due to legal protection was estimated by matching. Indigenous lands avoided the highest percentage of deforestation during the 2001-2004 and 2005-2008 periods, followed by those under strict protection and sustainable use areas, in respective order. Shifting patterns in deforestation avoidance are clearly noticeable for the 2009-2014 period when 1) strictly protected areas outperformed indigenous lands in terms of the percentage of saved forests, 2) some protected regions began to attract deforestation instead of avoiding it, and 3) sustainable use areas, on average, did not avoid deforestation.","[Jusys, Tomas] Euromonitor Int, Vilnius, Lithuania",,"Jusys, T (corresponding author), Euromonitor Int, Vilnius, Lithuania.",jusys.tomas@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,14,,,,,,,,,,,APR 24,2018.0,13.0,4,,,,,,e0195900,10.1371/journal.pone.0195900,,,,,,,,WOS:000430678800017,

However, the Landsat spatial resolution (30 m) has often been considered too coarse for reliably mapping small-scale selective logging. Imagery from the recently launched Sentinel-2 sensor, with a resampled 10 m spatial resolution, may improve the detection of forest disturbances. This study compared the performance of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data for the detection of selective logging in an area located in the Brazilian Amazon. Logging impacts in seven areas, which had governmental authorization for harvesting timber, were mapped by calculating the difference of a self-referenced normalized burn ratio (rNBR) index over corresponding time periods (2016-2017) for imagery of both satellite sensors. A robust reference dataset was built using both high- and very-high-resolution imagery. It was used to define optimum rNBR thresholds for forest disturbance maps, via a bootstrapping procedure, and for estimating accuracies and areas. A further assessment of our approach was also performed in three unlogged areas. Additionally, field data regarding logging infrastructure were collected in the seven study sites where logging occurred. Both satellites showed the same performance in terms of accuracy, with area-adjusted overall accuracies of 96.7% and 95.7% for Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8, respectively. However, Landsat 8 mapped 36.9% more area of selective logging compared to Sentinel-2 data. Logging infrastructure was better detected from Sentinel-2 (43.2%) than Landsat 8 (35.5%) data, confirming its potential for mapping small-scale logging. We assessed the impacted area by selective logging with a regular 300 m x 300 m grid over the pixel-based results, leading to 1143 ha and 1197 ha of disturbed forest on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data, respectively. No substantial differences in terms of accuracy were found by adding three unlogged areas to the original seven study sites.","[Lima, Thais Almeida; Griess, Verena C.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Resources Management, Forest Sci Ctr, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Beuchle, Rene; Langner, Andreas; Achard, Frederic] European Commiss, JRC, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Grecchi, Rosana Cristina] Via Piave 8A, I-21020 Ispra, Italy",,"Lima, TA (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Resources Management, Forest Sci Ctr, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",tha.almeida.lima@gmail.com; rene.beuchle@ec.europa.eu; andreas-johannes.langner@ec.europa.eu; rogrecchi@hotmail.com; verena.griess@ubc.ca; frederic.achard@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,35,35,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2,2019.0,11.0,8,,,,,,961,10.3390/rs11080961,,,,,,,,WOS:000467646800071,

We use matching, i.e., comparisons that are apples-to-apples in observed land characteristics, to address the fact that protected areas (PAs) tend to be located on lands facing less pressure. Correcting for that location bias lowers our estimates of PAs' forest impacts by roughly half. Further, it reveals significant variation in PA impacts along development-related dimensions: for example, the PAs that are closer to roads and the PAs closer to cities have higher impact.

The statistical results support our hypothesis. However, spatial patterns of deforestation are not a consequence of the main economic activities.

While a series of recent public actions and supply-chain commitments reportedly curbed the replacement of forests by soy, the expansion of the agricultural commodity still poses a considerable threat to the Amazonian and Cerrado biomes. Identification of areas under high risk of soy expansion is thus paramount to assist conservation efforts in the region. We mapped the areas suitable for undergoing transition to soy plantations in the Legal Amazon with a machine-learning approach adopted from the ecological modeling literature. Simulated soy expansion for the year 2014 exhibited favorable validation scores compared to other LUCC models. We then used our model to simulate how potential future infrastructure improvements would affect the 2014 probabilities of soy occurrence in the region. In addition to the 2.3 Mha of planted soy in the Legal Amazon in 2014, our model identified another 14.7 Mha with high probability of soy conversion in the region given the infrastructure conditions at that time. Out of those, pastures and forests represented 9.8 and 0.4 Mha, respectively. Under the new infrastructure scenarios simulated, the Legal Amazonian area under high risk of soy conversion increased by up to 2.1 Mha (14.6%). These changes led to up to 11.4 and 51.4% increases in the high-risk of conversion areas of pastures and forests, respectively. If conversion occurs in the identified high-risk areas, at least 4.8 Pg of CO2 could be released into the atmosphere, a value that represents 10 times the total CO2 emissions of Brazil in 2014. Our results highlight the importance of targeting conservation policies and enforcement actions, including the Soy Moratorium, to mitigate future forest cover loss associated with infrastructure improvements in the region.","[Frey, Gabriel P.; West, Thales A.

This article presents ethnographic research investigating the risks and value of working as a direct sales representative for global beauty brands in three Amazonian communities. While direct sales offers potentially significant income, in practice, most representatives earn meager profits dust break even; many lose money, and some fall into debt address the question of why women would pursue an activity with a high risk of financial loss from an institutional and feminist economic perspective, The findings reveal that the risk of debt, as well as the potential household contribution from direct sales, derives from the particular institutional environment that characterizes rural Amazonian communities. The appeal of direct sales lies in the opportunities it affords for social inclusion and enhancing household well-being. These opportunities include access to discounted consumer goods, social bonds through sales relationships, and participation in global ociality through direct sales catalogs and products.","[Chelekis, Jessica Andrea] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Mkt Sci & Management Div, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",,"Chelekis, JA (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Mkt Sci & Management Div, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",jessica.chelekis@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2017.0,4.0,2,,,,173,185,,10.1002/sea2.12086,,,,,,,,WOS:000427918900002,

It has been evolving throughout history with different definitions and approaches being utilized and continues to evolve as new elements are integrated. The environmental and temporal dimensions gained significant prominence in the 21st century, therefore the concept evolved to be also frequently mentioned as sustainable development. The following definition was used during the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2015: Sustainable development recognizes that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, combating inequality within and among countries, preserving the planet, creating sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and fostering social inclusion are linked to each other and are interdependent. Political ecology is a scientific field closely connected to the development agenda, as its ultimate goal is to promote sustainable development. With a focus on participatory methods, stakeholder networks and root causes, it provides a systemic perspective to human-environment systems. Another important benefit is that it promotes the connection between science and policy-making. From the political ecology perspective, this paper analyses the Amazon Fund, an initiative implemented by the Brazilian Government in 2009 to promote sustainable development. In the following years after the implementation of the Amazon Fund, considerable decrease in deforestation was observed at the Brazilian part of the Amazon Forest, including a record low in 2012, indicating the effectiveness of the project. Among the main results, the paper calls for strengthened environmental governance, the promotion of adaptative and multilevel approaches to governance and data and information generation for sustainable development.","[Ferreira de Souza, Guilherme Fernando] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Ferreira de Souza, Guilherme Fernando] Univ Nacoes Unidas, Tokyo, Japan",,"de Souza, GFF (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; de Souza, GFF (corresponding author), Univ Nacoes Unidas, Tokyo, Japan.",souzagff@gmail.com,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN-FEB,2021.0,12.0,1,,,,4,15,,10.23925/2179-3565.2021v12i1p04-15,,,,,,,,WOS:000640071400002,

Like many Amazonian indigenous peoples, the Kayapo have halted the expansion of the agricultural frontier on their lands but allow selective logging and gold mining. Prospects for long-term conservation and sustainability in these lands depend on indigenous peoples' understandings of their resource base and on available economic alternatives. Although forest conservation is not guaranteed by either tenure security or indigenous knowledge, indigenous societies' relatively egalitarian common property resource management regimes-along with adequate incentives and long-term partnerships with conservation organizations-can achieve this result. Successful initiatives include Conservation International's long-term project with the A'ukre Kayapo village and incipient large-scale territorial monitoring and control in the Kayapo territory, and the Instituto SocioAmbiental (ISA) 15-year partnership with the peoples of the Xingu Indigenous Park, with projects centered on territorial monitoring and control, education, community organization, and economic alternatives.

Although political ecologists have extensively considered scale as a methodological question, they have yet to develop an explicit theoretical approach to scale as an object of inquiry. We highlight one principal drawback to this underdeveloped approach to scale: what we call the local trap in which political ecologists assume that organization, policies, and action at the local scale are inherently more likely to have desired social and ecological effects than activities organized at other scales. Over the past 10 years or so, an increasingly sophisticated literature on scale has been developinvvvg among scholars in geography working in the political economy tradition. This literature has argued that scale is socially produced rather than ontologically given. Therefore, there is nothing inherent about any scale, and so the local scale cannot be intrinsically more desirable than other scales. We suggest that a greater engagement with this scale literature offers political ecology a theoretical way out of the local trap. As a first approximation of the kind of scalar analysis we advocate, we present a case study that examines the scalar politics that have shaped environmental change in the Brazilian Amazon.

The increasing pace of human development in coastal deltas over the past five decades has also strained local resources and produced extensive changes across both social and ecological systems. The Amazon estuary is located in the Amazon Basin, North Brazil, the largest river basin on Earth and also one of the least understood. A considerable segment of the population living in the estuary is directly dependent on the local extraction of natural resources for their livelihood. Areas sparsely inhabited may be exploited with few negative consequences for the environment. However, recent and increasing pressure on ecosystem services is maximised by a combination of factors such as governance, currency exchange rates, exports of beef and forest products. Here we present a cross methodological approach in identifying the political frontiers of forest cover change in the estuary with consequences for ecosystem services loss. We used a combination of data from earth observation satellites, ecosystem service literature, and official government statistics to produce spatially-explicit relationships linking the Green Vegetation Cover to the availability of ecosystems provided by forests in the estuary. Our results show that the continuous changes in land use/cover and in the economic state have contributed significantly to changes in key ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, climate regulation, and the availability of timber over the last thirty years.

Entropy (ENT) is calculated using tree height distribution from field vegetation inventory data and the adjusted entropy (adjENT) is then calculated by incorporating average stand height for each sample. The adjENT estimation model is developed using a linear regression analysis based on the integration of adjENT and measured TM reflectance. The successional stages are classified based on identified thresholds of adjENT values. The results shows that three successional stages (i.e., initial, intermediate, and advanced successional stages) can be classified with user's and producer's accuracies ranging from 77% to 79% and 61 % to 89%, which are much improved comparing with the result from the maximum likelihood classifier. The strong correlation between adjENT representing forest stand structure and the TM spectral signatures may provide new insights for estimation of forest stand parameters, such as biomass, and for detection of forest degradation.

An evaluation of the effectiveness and accuracy of existing environmental registries is crucial to assure the success of future efforts. This study presents an evaluation of deforestation and registration behavior in response to one of the largest of these property registration programs to date the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) in the Amazonian state of Para. From late 2007 to 2013, approximately 100,000 properties covering 30 million hectares of self-declared claims were entered in this digital registry. We used fixed effects regression models and property level data to assess how registration influenced deforestation on different sizes of properties. Registration had little impact on deforestation behavior, with the exception of a significant reduction on smallholder properties in the size range of 100-300 ha. We link this reduction to interacting incentives from forest protection and land regularization policies and suggest that desire to strengthen land claims motivates these landholders' response to the environmental registry. We also present evidence that some landholders may be registering incomplete or inaccurate parcels into the self-declared system to strategically benefit from policy incentives. Our results for smallholder properties indicate that environmental registries may have potential to facilitate reductions in deforestation if combined with a favorable combination of incentives. However, in places where land tenure is still being negotiated, the utility of environmental registries for forest policy enforcement and research may be limited without ongoing investment to resolve uncertainty around land claims.

Several factors were perceived as drivers of the crisis, however, its dynamics and consequences for natural resources and the environment remain largely unknown, particularly in Brazil. Combining grounded theory and case study methodologies, this research explores and contrasts the perspectives of highly knowledgeable stakeholders on how the GFC impacted sustainable forest management in the Brazilian Amazon, using the State of Para as a case study. Our findings indicate that the GFC cannot be considered as a unique phenomenon impacting SFM and that it is intimately linked to other political, social and environmental events unfolding within Brazil and at the global level. Decreased deforestation was perceived to have occurred due to restrained production, increased risk aversion, increased public awareness and enhanced government efforts towards law enforcement. The forest-based exporting segment was seen to suffer the most severe impacts of the crisis. Environmentally friendly initiatives were perceived to offer forest product differentiation in the market; while investments in non-market-oriented initiatives were restrained. Our results suggest that in times of economic crisis, forest policy-makers need to focus on both formal and informal forest economies in order to promote sustainable forest management objectives.

This approach deals with the problems of sample dependence and non-circularity of technical change measures. It allows us to measure output-by-output technical change. Furthermore, the geometric mean of the technical change measures derived using this approach satisfies circularity. The application of Malmquist indices to the panel datasets of agricultural production in the Brazilian Amazon during the period 1975-1995 indicates a non-Hicks-neutral technical change, with intersection of frontiers during both the 1975-1985 and the 1985-1995 sub-periods.

The paper provides an exploratory analysis of the recent changes that have occurred in the major elements of three tropical deltaic social-ecological systems, such as demography, economy, health, climate, food, and water. Time-series data from official statistics, monitoring programmes, and Earth observation data are analysed to explore possible trends, slow and fast variables, and observed drivers of change in the Amazon, Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Mekong deltas. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta zone, increasing gross domestic product and per capita income levels since the 1980s mirror rising levels of food and inland fish production. In contrast, non-food ecosystem services, such as water availability, water quality, and land stability appear to be deteriorating. In the Amazon delta, natural and anthropogenic perturbations are continuously degrading key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water balance, and the modulation of regional climate patterns. In the Mekong delta, rapid economic development, changing land-use practices, and salinity intrusion are progressively putting more pressure on the delivery of important provisioning services, such as rice and inland aquaculture production, which are key sources of staple food, farm incomes, and export revenue. Observed changes in many key indicators of ecosystem services point to a changing dynamic state and increased probability of systemic threshold transformations in the near future.","[de Araujo Barbosa, Caio Cesar] Univ Southampton, Global Environm Change & Earth Observat Res Grp, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Dearing, John; Hossain, Sarwar] Univ Southampton, Palaeoecol Lab, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Szabo, Sylvia; Matthews, Zoe] Univ Southampton, Social Stat & Demog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Nguyen Thanh Binh; Dang Kieu Nhan] Can Tho Univ, Mekong Delta Dev Res Inst, Can Tho, Vietnam",,"Barbosa, CCD (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Global Environm Change & Earth Observat Res Grp, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",CC.DeAraujoBarbosa@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2016.0,11.0,4,,,,555,574,,10.1007/s11625-016-0371-7,,,,,,,,WOS:000378781700004,

All land-clearing scenarios (2-6) contain significantly more growing season days with temperatures that exceed critical temperature thresholds for maize. Evaporative fraction significantly decreases across all land-clearing scenarios. Altered weather reduces maize yields between 6% and 8% compared with the before-extensive-land-clearing scenario; however, soy yields were not significantly affected. Our findings provide evidence that land clearing has degraded weather in the Brazilian Cerrado, undermining one of the main reasons for land clearing: rain-fed crop production.

Using models, this study finds that this clearing is degrading regional weather, reducing maize yields there.","[Spera, Stephanie A.] Univ Richmond, Dept Geog & Environm, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Spera, Stephanie A.] Dartmouth Coll, Neukom Inst Computat Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Spera, Stephanie A.; Winter, Jonathan M.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Winter, Jonathan M.; Partridge, Trevor F.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Earth Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",,"Spera, SA (corresponding author), Univ Richmond, Dept Geog & Environm, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.; Spera, SA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Neukom Inst Computat Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.; Spera, SA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",sspera@richmond.edu,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2020.0,3.0,10,,,,845,+,,10.1038/s41893-020-0560-3,,JUN 2020,,,,,,WOS:000544156000007,

Two independent studies of colonist and indigenous groups living in the NEA are used to compare their morbidity and mortality experiences. Colonist data are from a probability sample of land plots in 1999, while indigenous data are from a representative sample of the five largest ethnicities (Quichua. Shuar, Huaorani, Cofan, Secoya) collected in 2001. Poisson regression was used to compare morbidity. Results indicate clear differences in health between populations. Indigenous groups had 30% higher probability of mortality and 63% higher incidence rate of all-cause morbidity compared to colonists. Vector-borne, chronic, gastrointestinal, and diseases of unknown origin were particularly high among indigenous groups. Factors associated with morbidity varied: morbidity rates were similar for the two youngest age groups (0-4 and 5-9), but indigenous people aged 15-39 and 40+ had almost double the morbidity compared to colonists; larger households, later months of data collection and less pollution were associated with less morbidity in both groups; better infrastructure access (electricity and roads) was generally associated with lower morbidity in both groups; and associations of land use were different by group with more cultivation of perennials and fewer annuals associated with less morbidity for colonists, but more for indigenous groups. These results demonstrate the health disparities that exist among indigenous and non-indigenous populations even when living in the same geographic region. Land use itself exemplifies the cultural and contextual differences that are evident in health, since land use decisions are related to broader demographic and economic factors that influence overall ecological and human health. Ongoing population-environment and/or environment-health research needs to recognize the broader factors involved when studying relationships between population health, development and deforestation.

Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies. The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC=0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: Protected areas-Intangible zone (PC=24%, PI=12.4%), timber harvesting programs (PC=21.7%, PI=4.7%), road network (PC=18.9%, PI=7.7%), and poverty rate (PC=3.7%, PI=6.1%). Also, the biophysical variable temperature (PC=7,9%, PI=22.3%) provided information in the overall model. The results suggested the need for changes in forest management strategies. Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, binary maps may fall short regarding the optimum representation of this type of disturbance, as tree harvest in tropical forests can be highly heterogeneous. Objectives The objective of this study is to map forest disturbance intensities in areas of selective logging located in the Brazilian Amazon. Methods Selective logging activities were mapped in ten forest management units using Sentinel-2 data at 10 mresolution. A spatial pattern analysis was applied to the logging map, using a moving window approach with different window sizes. Two landscape metrics were used to derive a forest disturbance intensity map. This map was then compared with actual disturbances using field data and a post-harvest forest recovery analysis. Results Disturbed areas were grouped into five distinct disturbance intensity classes, from very low to very high. Classes high and very high were found to be related to log landings and large felling gaps, while very low intensities were mainly related to isolated disturbance types. The post-harvest forest recovery analysis showed that the five classes can be clearly distinguished from one another, with the clearest differences in the year of logging and one year after it. Conclusions The approach described represents an important step towards a better mapping of selectively logged areas, when compared to the use of binary maps. The disturbance intensity classes could be used as indicators for forest monitoring as well as for further evaluation of areas under forest management.","[Lima, Thais Almeida; Griess, Verena C.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Forest Sci Ctr, Dept Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Beuchle, Rene; Verhegghen, Astrid; Vogt, Peter] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",,"Lima, TA (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Forest Sci Ctr, Dept Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",tha.almeida.lima@gmail.com; rene.beuchle@ec.europa.eu; verena.griess@ubc.ca; astrid.verhegghen@ec.europa.eu; peter.vogt@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2020.0,35.0,9,,,,2083,2100,,10.1007/s10980-020-01080-y,,AUG 2020,,,,,,WOS:000557115300001,

The aim was to remove deforestation from the soybean supply chain and halt one of the main drivers of forest loss in the Amazon biome. In this study, we investigated changes in deforestation at the property-level for the period 2004 to 2014. The objective was to examine direct and indirect deforestation, defined as on-property displacement and cross-parcel displacement deforestation for soybean expansion in the Amazon region of Mato Grosso, the leading soy-producing state of the Brazilian Amazon. We used publicly available property and land use data to quantify deforestation associated with cropland expansion. Similar to previous studies, we found that direct deforestation for soybean expansion declined following the implementation of the Soy Moratorium. Moreover, our analysis suggest that indirect deforestation occurred already before the implementation of the Soy Moratorium, and decreased following the first period of analyses. However, slight increases of indirect deforestation in the more recent periods, combined with decreasing direct deforestations rendered indirect deforestation to be responsible for more than half of the deforestation associated with soybean expansion. While we acknowledge the overall reduction of deforestation for soybean, our results suggest, given the increasing trends of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2013, to address indirect deforestation within the Soy Moratorium. This may be achieved by zero-property-deforestation commitments and by strengthening the integration between supply-chain actors, the soybean and beef purchasing companies and the federal policies aiming to control deforestation.","[Gollnow, Florian; Hissa, Leticia de Barros Viana; Rufin, Philippe; Lakes, Tobia] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Gollnow, Florian] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, 1 Pk Pl,Suite 300, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [Hissa, Leticia de Barros Viana; Rufin, Philippe; Lakes, Tobia] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",,"Gollnow, F (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, 1 Pk Pl,Suite 300, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA.",fgollnow@sesync.org,,,,,,,36,38,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2018.0,78.0,,,,,377,385,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.07.010,,,,,,,,WOS:000449447900036,

These policies were developed in the aftermath of large-scale fire events and reflect a conservationist discourse that responded to internal as well as international environmental concerns. In doing so, the policies have framed the fire problem around those who use fire in their land use practices, in particular small-scale agriculturalists. Yet, land policy in general has repeatedly failed to address the institutional arrangements which compel small-scale farmers to use fire in their agricultural practices and the underlying development processes that have made the landscape more vulnerable to accidental spread of fire. Using regional level data on small-scale farmers, I suggest that the conservation oriented approach of fire policy may not be enough to curtail accidental fire events and instead that the fire issue needs to be positioned within rural development as well.

The resulting tension is reflected in Brazilian government policy. The national agrarian reform program has settled farm families in the Amazon region since the 1970s, with the expectation that they will clear forests in order to farm the land. On the other hand, recent Brazilian policy initiatives seek to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change. We contribute to the policy debate that surrounds these dual goals for the Amazon by estimating the marginal effects of new agricultural land on the full income and assets of farm settlers over a 13-year period from 1996 to 2009. Using micro panel data from agrarian settlements where forest was being rapidly cleared, and controlling for factors that would otherwise confound the relationship, we estimate the effect of converting forest to agriculture on total household income to estimate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our measure of income reflects any re-allocation of resources by utility maximizing households and any productivity effects due to loss of forest ecosystem services. The estimated effect of new agricultural land on income is positive, but small relative to the income per hectare of previously cleared land. However, we show that income increases investment in physical assets, which raises households' income generating capacity and future accumulation of assets. Thus, while there is only a small immediate income gain from clearing more forest, the long-term effects on wealth are still substantial. This demonstrates that given the right conditions, conversion of forest to agricultural land can be an impetus for asset accumulation by smallholders. It also highlights the importance of considering the indirect and long-term welfare benefits of new agricultural land when assessing the opportunity costs of forest conservation.","[Mullan, Katrina] Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Sills, Erin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27701 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill] Salisbury Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, Salisbury, MD 21804 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill] Salisbury Univ, Environm Studies Dept, Salisbury, MD 21804 USA",,"Mullan, K (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",katrina.mullan@umontana.edu; sills@nscu.edu; subhrendu.pattanayak@duke.edu; jlcaviglia-harris@salisbury.edu,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2018.0,71.0,2,,,,427,455,,10.1007/s10640-017-0164-1,,,,,,,,WOS:000444453900006,

Anopheline indices for populated communities in the peri-Iquitos region of Loreto have been reported to be remarkably low, with entomological inoculation rates (EIR) estimated at one to 30 infective bites per year based on a few studies in close proximity to the urban centre of Iquitos and surrounding deforested areas. Local reports suggest that a large number of the reported cases are contracted outside of populated communities in undeveloped riverine areas frequented by loggers and fishermen. Methods: To better understand vectorial capacity in suspected high malaria transmission zones in a rural district near Iquitos, Peru, mosquito collections were conducted at different points in the seasonality of malaria transmission in 21 sites frequented by occupational labourers. Prevalence of Plasmodium spp in vectors was determined by circumsporozoite protein ELISA on individual mosquitoes. Slide surveillance was performed for humans encountered in the zone. Results: In total, of 8,365 adult female mosquitoes examined, 98.5% were identified as Anopheles darlingi and 117 (1.4%) tested positive for sporozoites (P. falciparum, P. vivax VK210 or P. vivax VK247). Measured human biting rates at these sites ranged from 0.102 to 41.13 bites per person per hour, with EIR values as high as 5.3 infective bites per person per night. Six percent of the 284 blood films were positive for P. vivax or P. falciparum; however, 88% of the individuals found to be positive were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. Conclusions: The results of this study provide key missing indices of prominent spatial and temporal heterogeneity of vectorial capacity in the Amazon Basin of Peru. The identification of a target human subpopulation as a principal reservoir and dispersion source of Plasmodium species has important implications for vaccine development and the delivery of effective targeted malaria control strategies.","[Parker, Benjamin S.; Yori, Pablo Penataro; Kosek, Margaret] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Olortegui, Maribel Paredes; Pinedo, Silvia Rengifo; Chavez, Cesar Banda] Asociac Benef Prisma, Iquitos, Peru; [Escobedo, Karin] US Naval Med Res Ctr Unit 6, Iquitos, Peru; [Florin, David] US Naval Med Res Ctr Unit 6, Lima, Peru; [Greffa, Roldan Cardenas; Vega, Luis Capcha; Ferrucci, Hugo Rodriguez] Minist Hlth, Punchana, Loreto, Peru; [Pan, William K.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Vinetz, Joseph M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Kosek, M (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St,Room E5545, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",mkosek@jhsph.edu,,,,,,,43,43,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 31,2013.0,12.0,,,,,,,178,10.1186/1475-2875-12-178,,,,,,,,WOS:000319942800002,

This paper takes a biocultural approach and reports longitudinal data on the anthropometry, dietary intakes and energy expenditure of a sample of 23 rural, lactating Ribeirinha women living in subsistence-based communities in the eastern Amazon. The dietary intakes of these lactating women were insufficient to meet their lactating energy needs and were least sufficient during resguardo, a 40-day period in the immediate postpartum when the women observed a series of food taboos and work restrictions. Instead, the women in this study met the increased energy demands of lactation by drawing on their energy reserves and reducing their energy expenditure in physical activity. The women showed a significant reduction in weight (P < 0.001), BMI (P < 0.001) and in circumferences (hip, P = 0.01; waist, P = 0.03) and skinfolds (thigh, P = 0.03) in the gluteal femoral region. Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) was lowest during resguardo and increased as lactation progressed (P = 0.01). While the practice of resguardo reduced maternal energy expenditure and allowed women more time to spend with their newborn infants, it came at a cost (low dietary intake), which appears to be related to the loss of the adult woman from subsistence activities. By taking a biocultural approach this study illustrates the role the social environment plays in shaping the experience of lactating women.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Piperata, BA (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Anthropol, 124 W 17th Ave,Lord Hall Rm 113-A, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",piperata.1@osu.edu,,,,,,,33,34,,,,,,,,,,,SEP-OCT,2007.0,19.0,5,,,,722,734,,10.1002/ajhb.20628,,,,,,,,WOS:000248987100015,

There is substantial research on the connections between international meat consumption and the destruction of Latin American environments, but less is known about the links between production/destruction and consumption in developing settings. In the western Amazon state of Acre, Brazil, increasing beef consumption is directly linked with local cattle production and environmental destruction, providing an opportunity to examine the relationships between these processes in a developing context. Interviews, participant-observation, and a standardized survey provide data on perceptions of beef and meat preferences, and how these relate to practices and patterns of consumption among a range of groups, from urban environmentalists to beef-loving cowboys. The results reveal how the hierarchical ordering of foods, with beef at the top, maps onto similar hierarchies of status and class, as well as notions of strength and nutrition. The analysis of beef consumption in a developing setting illustrates how beef is both a signifier of development and the symbolic and material fuel for a development process in which individuals, society, and the environment are transformed and improved. This study of local connections complements macro-and regional-level research on destruction and consumption linkages by offering insights on why consumers in a developing setting choose beef, and how the rubble and destruction of expanding Latin American agricultural frontiers is hidden, ignored, or written off in a discourse emphasizing the social and economic benefits of development.","[Hoelle, Jeffrey] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Anthropol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Hoelle, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Anthropol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",hoelle@anth.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,14,14,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,24.0,,,,,743,762,,10.2458/v24i1.20964,,,,,,,,WOS:000436953100003,

The usual approach to analyze these data, however, often ignores a) changes in the total number of individuals examined, b) the bias towards symptomatic individuals in routine government surveillance, and; c) the influence that observations can have on disease dynamics. Here, we highlight the consequences of ignoring the problems listed above and develop a novel modeling framework to circumvent them, which is illustrated using simulations and real malaria data. Our simulations reveal that trends in the number of disease cases do not necessarily imply similar trends in infection prevalence or incidence, due to the strong influence of concurrent changes in sampling effort. We also show that ignoring decreases in the pool of infected individuals due to the treatment of part of these individuals can hamper reliable inference on infection incidence. We propose a model that avoids these problems, being a compromise between phenomenological statistical models and mechanistic disease dynamics models; in particular, a cross-validation exercise reveals that it has better out-of-sample predictive performance than both of these alternative models. Our case study in the Brazilian Amazon reveals that infection prevalence was high in 2004-2008 (prevalence of 4% with 95% CI of 35%), with outbreaks (prevalence up to 18%) occurring during the dry season of the year. After this period, infection prevalence decreased substantially (0.9% with 95% CI of 0.8-1.1%), which is due to a large reduction in infection incidence (i.e., incidence in 2008-2010 was approximately one fifth of the incidence in 2004-2008). We believe that our approach to modeling government surveillance disease data will be useful to advance current understanding of large-scale drivers of several diseases.","[Valle, Denis] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Trop Conservat & Dev Program, Ctr Latin Amer Studies,Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Clark, James] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Dept Biol, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Valle, D (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Trop Conservat & Dev Program, Ctr Latin Amer Studies,Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",drvalle1@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2013.0,9.0,11,,,,,,e1003312,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003312,,,,,,,,WOS:000330357200016,

Our article describes a novel modeling framework that overcomes this challenge, resulting in enhanced understanding of malaria in the Western Brazilian Amazon. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cohort of 486 individuals was monitored using four cross-sectional surveys, where all participants were sampled regardless of symptoms (aggressive-active case detection), resulting in 1,383 microscopy and 1,400 polymerase chain reaction tests. Data on the same individuals were also obtained from the local surveillance facility (i.e., passive and active case detection), totaling 1,694 microscopy tests. Our model accommodates these multiple pathogen and case detection methods. This model is shown to outperform logistic regression in terms of interpretability of its parameters, ability to recover the true parameter values, and predictive performance. We reveal that the main infection determinant was the extent of forest, particularly during the rainy season and in close proximity to water bodies, and participation on forest activities. We find that time residing in Acrelandia (as a proxy for past malaria exposure) decreases infection risk but surprisingly increases the likelihood of reporting symptoms once infected, possibly because non-naive settlers are only susceptible to more virulent Plasmodium strains. We suggest that the search for asymptomatic carriers should focus on those at greater risk of being infected but lower risk of reporting symptoms once infected. Conclusions/Significance: The modeling framework presented here combines cross-sectional survey data and syndromic sentinel surveillance data to shed light on several aspects of malaria that are critical for public health policy. This framework can be adapted to enhance inference on infectious diseases whenever asymptomatic carriers are important and multiple datasets are available.","[Valle, Denis; Clark, James S.] Duke Univ, Univ Program Ecol, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Clark, James S.; Zhao, Kaiguang] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA; [Clark, James S.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Valle, D (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Univ Program Ecol, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",drv4@duke.edu,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 8,2011.0,6.0,11,,,,,,e27462,10.1371/journal.pone.0027462,,,,,,,,WOS:000297349700048,

The most productive areas are the floodplains of the Amazon River which are built up by suspended solids deriving from the Andes. The study was focused on the varzea forest, where a relatively high potential for sustainable agro-forestry can be assumed. Since nitrogen may be the limiting factor, N-2 fixation by nodulated legumes was extensively studied. Legumes provided an annual nitrogen gain between 12.9 and 16.1 kg N ha(-1). Considering all available data of input and output, the nitrogen balance was positive. The amount of nitrogen stored in the biomass of the varzea forest is about 50 times the annual nitrogen input.

Restorationists working in most tropical settings are usually hampered by lack of basic information on the wide variety of native tree species that characterize the pre-disturbance forests, as well as insufficient understanding of the ecology of disturbance and natural recovery to design effective restoration programs. A notable exception to this is the forest restoration program developed since the early 1980s by a Brazilian bauxite mining company operating at Trombetas in Para State in central Amazonia. A systematic nursery and field research strategy was used to develop a reforestation program based on mixed plantings of mon than 70 native old-growth forest tree species. This technique has been used to replant about 100 ha of deforested minelands each year over the past 15 years. Research in recent years has evaluated this approach and other, generally simpler, reforestation methods used at a smaller scale at this site. Post-plantation biodiversity development and other indicators of restoration success or sustainability were recorded. The results of these studies have shown the overwhelming importance of careful site preparation and topsoil handling/replacement practices in determining both future productivity and biodiversity of the redeveloping forests, irrespective of the complexity of the planting design used. The inclusion of a wide variety of forest species, particularly later successional species, was very important for long-range restoration owing to limitations on natural recovery processes that inhibit seed dispersal and subsequent colonization of many old-growth forest species.

We focus on the rapidly expanding cattle industry or pecuarizacao'' (cattleization) as well as a potentially competing land use strategy: the planting and harvesting of annual and perennial crops. We identify spatial error in our initial estimations and as a result use corrected models of land use with greater explanatory power and efficiency. Estimation results indicate that both pasture creation and agriculture are determined by similar household and spatial characteristics; however, the impacts of these determinants are in opposing directions for both land uses estimated. We conclude from our survey and satellite comparisons that while remote sensing data may overestimate the extent of pasture, the overestimation is minor. Finally, based on the current extent of pasture, we also conclude that policy that focuses on reducing deforestation within these long-established settlements is most likely inefficient. Rather, policy that addresses the land use practices employed by recent settlers may be more effective in reducing further pasture creation.","[Caviglia-Harris, Jill L.] Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD USA; [Harris, Daniel W.] Salisbury Univ, Dept Geog & Geosci, Salisbury, MD USA",,"Caviglia-Harris, JL (corresponding author), Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD USA.",jlcaviglia-harris@salisbury.edu; dwharris@salisbury.edu,,,,,,,16,16,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2008.0,31.0,2,,,,115,137,,10.1177/0160017607312815,,,,,,,,WOS:000254080200001,

Semistructured interviews (N = 64) were conducted with both male and female heads of household from June to August 2014. We tested the effect of household-level livelihood assets associated with material and relational well-being on project participation.

Individual perceptions indicated that project supporters were motivated by income, whereas nonsupporters most frequently criticized the low price of timber. Both groups expressed concern about the potential environmental impacts of logging. By gender, supportive men were more motivated by financial aspects, whereas supportive women pointed to improved physical assets. Men opposed to the logging project highlighted governance issues, whereas nonsupportive women tended to express environmental concerns.

This study examines how both fire dynamics and bioclimatic factors varied based on the season (wet season and dry season) El Nino years across the different countries and ecosystems within the Amazon rainforest. Data from publicly available databases on forest fires (Global Fire Atlas) and bioclimatic, topographic and anthropogenic variables were employed in the analysis. Linear mixed-effect models discovered that year type (El Nino vs. non-El Nino), seasonality (dry vs. wet), land cover and forest strata (in terms of canopy cover and intactness) and their interactions varied across the Amazonian countries (and the different ecosystems) under consideration. A machine learning model, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), was utilized to determine the relative importance of climatic, topographic, forest structure and human modification variables on fire dynamics across wet and dry seasons, both in El Nino and non-El Nino years. The findings of this study make clear that declining precipitation and increased temperatures have strong impact on fire dynamics (size, duration, expansion and speed) for El Nino years. El Nino years also saw greater fire sizes and speeds as compared to non-El Nino years. Dense and relatively undisturbed forests were found to have the lowest fire activity and increased human impact on a landscape was associated with exacerbated fire dynamics, especially in the El Nino years. Additionally, the presence of grass-dominated ecosystems such as grasslands also acted as a driver of fire in both El Nino and non-El Nino years. Hence, from a conservation perspective, increased interventions during the El Nino periods should be considered.","[Singh, Minerva] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Zhu, Xiaoxiang] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",,"Singh, M (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, London, England.",minerva_singh@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 7,2021.0,9.0,,,,,,,,10.7717/peerj.12029,,,,,,,,WOS:000707215900002,

To date, fires have generally been spatially co-located with road networks and associated human land use because almost all fires in this region are anthropogenic in origin. Climate change, if severe enough, could alter this situation, potentially changing the fire regime to one of increased fire frequency and severity for vast portions of the Amazon forest. High moisture contents and dense canopies have historically made Amazonian forests extremely resistant to fire spread. Climate will affect the fire situation in the Amazon directly, through changes in temperature and precipitation, and indirectly, through climate-forced changes in vegetation composition and structure. The frequency of drought will be a prime determinant of both how often forest fires occur and how extensive they become. Fire risk management needs to take into account landscape configuration, land cover types and forest disturbance history as well as climate and weather. Maintaining large blocks of unsettled forest is critical for managing landscape level fire in the Amazon. The Amazon has resisted previous climate changes and should adapt to future climates as well if landscapes can be managed to maintain natural fire regimes in the majority of forest remnants.","[Cochrane, Mark A.; Barber, Christopher P.] S Dakota State Univ, Geog Informat Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57007 USA",,"Cochrane, MA (corresponding author), S Dakota State Univ, Geog Informat Sci Ctr Excellence, 1021 Medary Ave,Wecota Hall,Box 506B, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",Mark.Cochrane@sdstate.edu,,,,,,,136,139,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2009.0,15.0,3,,,,601,612,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01786.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000263134600006,

The Advanced Land-Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were acquired during a six month interval. A clear-sky Landsat-5/TM image acquired at the same period was used as additional ground reference and as ancillary input data in the classification scheme. We evaluated backscattering intensity, polarimetric features, interferometric coherence and texture parameters for classification purposes using support vector machines (SVM) and feature selection. Results showed that the forest classes were characterized by low temporal backscattering intensity variability, low coherence and high entropy. Quad polarization mode performed better than dual and single polarizations but overall accuracies remain low and were affected by precipitation events on the date and prior SAR date acquisition. Misclassifications were reduced by integrating Landsat data and an overall accuracy of 85% was attained. The integration of Landsat to both quad and dual polarization modes showed similarity at the 5% significance level. SVM was not affected by SAR dimensionality and feature selection technique reveals that co-polarized channels as well as SAR derived parameters such as Alpha-Entropy decomposition were important ranked features after Landsat' near-infrared and green bands. We show that in absence of Landsat data, polarimetric features extracted from quad-polarization L-band increase classification accuracies when compared to single and dual polarization alone. We argue that the joint analysis of SAR and their derived parameters with optical data performs even better and thus encourage the further development of joint techniques under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism.

About the limitations of environmental policies in the Amazon and the potential of achieving environmental goals through pro-poor policies,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Once again, the international community focuses on the preservation of Amazonian forests, in particular through a bundle of initiatives grouped under the term of REDD+. Initially focusing on reducing carbon emissions, the REDD+ process became increasingly linked with developmental goals that represent the primary interest of all Amazon countries. In consequence, REDD+ can be seen as another attempt to achieve the twin goals of environmental protection and rural development, and consequently, relies on the strategies and tools of past efforts. Against this background, we explore past experiences with key strategies for environmental protection and poverty alleviation in the Amazon to critically reflect about the potential of REDD+ to contribute to sustainable local development in the region. The analysis demonstrates that initiatives that pursued environmental goals mostly led to more restrictions and bureaucratic barriers to local forest users, while the prevailing approaches to promote rural dwellers showed ambivalent environmental outcomes. Reasons for these unsatisfactory results include the sectoral alignment of the measures and the poor coordination and lack of coherence with decisive policy areas. Most critically, the environmental and social initiatives themselves rely on the classic development approach widely disregarding smallholders' capacities to contribute to local development. The manifold pilot activities emerging under the new REDD+ framework tend to repeat these shortcomings, thereby further accelerating the replacement of local socio-productive schemes with unsustainable land uses. In view of the growing consensus about the ecological incompatibility, social limitations and economic risks of classic development, an alternative vision of development is needed, which more consciously takes into account the immense social and environmental potential of the region. Considering that REDD+ is still at the start, there might be possibilities to re-adjust the framework and thereby turn it into a real contribution to the sustainable development of rural Amazon.","[Pokorny, Benno] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; [de Jong, Wil] Kyoto Univ, CIAS, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",,"Pokorny, B (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,48,48,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,18.0,2,,,,,,3,10.5751/ES-05458-180203,,,,,,,,WOS:000321257100026,

The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of aquatic environments that are associated with high levels of Hg in ichthyofauna. Our research aimed at determining the influence of variables related to fish ecology, types of aquatic environment, fishing activities by local riparian populations, and watershed use on the levels of contamination of ichthyofauna. Six sites were sampled during two distinct periods of the hydrological cycle: at the beginning of descending waters and during low waters. We focused on ten dominant fish species representing four trophic levels: Curimata inornata, Geophagus proximus, Schizodon vittatum, Leporinus fasciatus, Anostomoides laticeps, Hemiodus unimaculatus, Caenotropus labyrinthicus, Hoplias malabaricus, Plagioscion squamosissimus, Acestrorhynchus falcirostris. The study sites, which included lotic and lentic habitats, are exploited year-round by local riparian communities. Spatial variations in Hg contamination in ichthyofauna were determined by factorial analysis of variance taking into account fish diets, seasons, and sampling sites. Multiple regressions were used to check the influence of ecological and anthropogenic variables and variables related to watershed uses, on Hg levels in key species representing the four trophic groups. Each variable was checked independently. Next, multiple regressions were used to verify the concomitant influence of selected variables. Independently of the study site and the phase of the hydrologic cycle, fish Hg contamination followed the trend piscivores > omnivores > herbivores > detritivores. In all the aquatic study sites, Hg levels measured in predatory species were often higher than the 500 ng/g fresh weight threshold. Mean Hg levels in key species were significantly higher during descending waters in lotic environments, and during low waters in lentic environments. Data from this study demonstrated that simple models based on watershed use and on easily obtained variables such as the suspended particulate matter (SPM) load and SPM Hg concentrations, number of inhabitants, habitat types, and the stage in the hydrological cycle enable very good prediction of Hg levels in fish. Our cartographical data clearly showed that the watershed site with the highest aquatic vegetation cover (6% of the open water body) and with the lowest forest cover (62% of the land) corresponded to the highest Hg concentrations in fish. Conversely, the watershed site with 94% forest cover and 1% aquatic vegetation corresponded to the lowest levels Hg concentrations in fish. These results suggest that land uses of watersheds play a key role in the level of Hg contamination of local ichthyofauna. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[da Silva, D.

In practice, selecting suitable image data for such purposes remains difficult due to a poor understanding of forest stand parameters and remote-sensing spectral response relationships, particularly in moist tropical regions. This paper explores relationships between forest stand parameters and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral responses through analyses of three study areas in the eastern Amazon basin (Altamira, Bragantina, and Ponta de Pedras). Six TM bands and many vegetation indices are examined through integration of spectral responses and field vegetation inventory data. Pearson's correlation coefficients are used to interpret relationships between forest stand parameters and TM data. This study concludes that single band TM5 and linear transformed indices such as PC1 (the first component in a principal component analysis), KT1 (brightness of the tasseled cap transform), and albedo are most strongly correlated with forest stand parameters, somewhat independent of biophysical environments. Many vegetation indices that use TM4 and TM3 data, such as the atmospherically resistant vegetation index, the atmospheric and soil vegetation index, and the normalized difference vegetation index, are weakly correlated with selected forest stand parameters. In contrast, vegetation indices using band TM5 data improve correlations with selected forest stand parameters in Altamira forests that are characterized by a complex stand structure. Forest stand structure and associated canopy shadow affect the forest stand parameters and TM spectral response relationships. This paper provides a better understanding of relationships that have a potential of being important for developing stand parameter estimation models and for improvement of vegetation classification accuracy.

Study draws its hypothesis from the understanding that the Amazon Fund operated until recently based on a nuanced integration of two current trends in environmental governance: (i) institutionalization of ecological modernization theories and (ii) establishment of multilevel, multi-stakeholder governance. To visualize such integration, this work deploys discourse analysis and text-mining techniques to the Amazon Fund's policy documents. Overall findings suggest the ecological modernization agenda is predominant within the Amazon Fund. The following discussion articulates with environmental studies' critical scholarship to debate the dominance of ecological modernism as it is claimed to inherently narrow the scope of perspectives, knowledge, and values integrated into sustainability policies. Whereas the opposite should occur, considering multi-stakeholder environmental governance mechanisms propose to incorporate a plurality of legitimate perspectives and knowledge basis. In these terms, innovative approaches that envision win-win solutions for environmental policy may eventually rest in endorsing alternative framings about nature and society that move away from the constrained paradigms of efficiency within ecological modernization theories and discourse. The relevance of this work lays in the debate that acknowledges the importance of driving environmental governance mechanisms in tropical developing countries to new viable alternatives. In broader terms, the importance of this debate emerges in the proposal of changes that move government, business, and civil society away from usual policies (and interests) underpinning policies for land use and the forest sector.","[Bidone, Francisco] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Bellaterra, Spain",,"Bidone, F (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Bellaterra, Spain.",francisco.bidone@e-campus.uab.cat,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022.0,32.0,2,,,,110,121,,10.1002/eet.1969,,NOV 2021,,,,,,WOS:000722076200001,

Through the creation of an 8-year record of thrice daily shallow cumulus cloud cover at 1 km resolution from multi-spectral satellite imagery, we quantitatively show the existence of a significant climatic shift in shallow cloudiness patterns associated with deforestation.

The obtained results will help to understand the impact of man's footprint on the Amazon rain-forest.","[Dominguez, David; del Villar, Luis de Juan] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Escuela Politecn Super, Dept Ingn Informat, Grp Neurocomputac Biol, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Pantoja, Odette] Escuela Politec Nacl, Grp Invest Multidisciplinar Sistemas Informac Ges, Quito 170525, Ecuador; [Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Mario] Univ Amer, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, SI2Lab, Quito 170124, Ecuador",,"Gonzalez-Rodriguez, M (corresponding author), Univ Amer, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, SI2Lab, Quito 170124, Ecuador.",david.dominguez@uam.es; luisjvca@gmail.com; odette.pantoja@epn.edu.ec; mario.gonzalez.rodriguez@udla.edu.ec,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022.0,14.0,2,,,,,,691,10.3390/su14020691,,,,,,,,WOS:000747447400001,

In the present study, we investigate the extent to which urban air plumes modify the levels of ozone (O-3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the downwind rain forest. The median mixing ratios of the background O-3, NOx, and NOx oxidation products (NOz) were 20 (15 parts per billion on a volume basis, ppbv), 0.6 ppbv (0.6 ppbv), and 1.0 ppbv (0.5 ppbv) during the dry (wet) season at the study site. Compared to the background environment, air plumes from the city of Manaus had enhanced median mixing ratios for O-3 and NOz by 30-50% and 40-90%, respectively. However, the enhancements of NOx in the air plumes were less than 20%, indicating that the majority of NOx was chemically converted to O-3 and NOx during transport. Results from a photochemical model showed that an injection of 8 ppbv of NOx into the rain forest can cause up to 260% and 150% increases in O-3 and hydroxyl radical (OH) levels compared to the background conditions, indicating the likely extent that NOx can modify the air quality and oxidative capacity in the Amazon rain forest. Slopes of the 0 3 -temperature linear relationships increased with NOx levels from 3.7 to 6.5 ppbv per degree Kelvin during the dry season and 1.7-5.5 ppbv per degree Kelvin during the wet season. Average rates of change of the slope with respect to NOz were approximately 1.8 and 2.3 times higher than those with respect to NOx for the dry and wet seasons. One key conclusion of this study is that NOz substantially contributed to the O-3 formation in response to temperature under enhanced NOx conditions in the forested environment.","[Wei, Dandan; Fuentes, Jose D.; Gerken, Tobias] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Trowbridge, Amy M.; Stoy, Paul C.] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Chamecki, Marcelo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",,"Fuentes, JD (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jdfuentes@psu.edu,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1,2019.0,206.0,,,,,280,292,,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.02.044,,,,,,,,WOS:000466251600024,

Observations acquired as part of A Multidisciplinary Amazon Shelf SEDiment Study (AMASSEDS) are used to characterize the spatial structure and temporal variability of the Amazon Plume. Four shipboard conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) surveys spanning the shelf from 1 degrees S to 5 degrees N during rising (March 1990), maximum (May 1990), falling (August 1989), and minimum (November 1991) discharge show the Amazon Plume is typically 3 to 10 m thick and 80 to over 200 km wide. Northwest of the river mouth, the plume is often characterized by a wedge of low-salinity water adjacent to the coast and a separate tongue of low-salinity water extending offshore over the middle to outer shelf. A bottom front separating the low-salinity plume water from oceanic water is consistently located between the 10- and 20-m isobaths. A moored array deployed about 300 km northwest of the river mouth from February to June 1990 included inner and midshelf moorings in 18 and 65 m of water on which temperature-conductivity measurements were made. The moored observations reveal salinity variations within the Amazon Plume of over 10 psu on timescales of days to weeks. This variability includes intermittent events in which plume water pools up in the vicinity of the river mouth and the plume width can exceed 200 km. These accumulation events are apparently due to wind events with a southeastward component which impede or block the normally northwestward freshwater transport. The resulting bulges in the plume are then released northwestward when the wind reverses. Volume budgets indicate the Amazon Plume entrains roughly twice the river discharge between the river mouth at the equator and 3 degrees N. Estimates of gradient Richardson numbers from the moorings suggest entrainment, due to the strong semidiurnal tidal currents, occurs where the plume intersects the bottom and over the outer portion of the plume, where salinities approach oceanic values.","WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, DEPT PHYS OCEANOG, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA",,,,,,,,,,114,116,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 15,1995.0,100.0,C2,,,,2355,2375,,10.1029/94JC01411,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QK37200005,

The economics literature generally suggests that non-use values don't exist among the poor and in the informal sector of the economy. We examine this issue through a choice modeling experiment. A survey was conducted of rainforest communities who live on the banks of the Amazon River (Rio Solimoes), in the vicinity of proposed oil and gas pipelines. The data were analyzed in the choice modeling framework, revealing relatively high amounts of compensation that were necessary in order to accept the potential ecosystem damages associated with oil transport, even if the people were completely compensated for direct damages such as loss of access to productive resources. These results suggest that environmental quality is important for its own sake, a result that is very different from the implicit assumption among many economists. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, historical deforestation and emission rates. critical inputs for setting reference emission levels for REDD+. are poorly understood. Here we use multi-source, time-series satellite data to quantify carbon emissions from deforestation in the Amazon basin on a year-to-year basis between 2000 and 2010. We first derive annual deforestation indicators by using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Vegetation Continuous Fields (MODIS VCF) product. MODIS indicators are calibrated by using a large sample of Landsat data to generate accurate deforestation rates, which are subsequently combined with a spatially explicit biomass dataset to calculate committed annual carbon emissions. Across the study area, the average deforestation and associated carbon emissions were estimated to be 1.59 +/- 0.25M ha.yr(-1) and 0.18 +/- 0.07 Pg C.yr(-1) respectively, with substantially different trends and inter-annual variability in different regions. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased between 2001 and 2004 and declined substantially afterwards, whereas deforestation in the Bolivian Amazon, the Colombian Amazon, and the Peruvian Amazon increased over the study period. The average carbon density of lost forests after 2005 was 130 Mg C.ha(-1), similar to 11% lower than the average carbon density of remaining forests in year 2010 (144 Mg C.ha(-1)). Moreover, the average carbon density of cleared forests increased at a rate of 7 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) from 2005 to 2010, suggesting that deforestation has been progressively encroaching into high-biomass lands in the Amazon basin. Spatially explicit, annual deforestation and emission estimates like the ones derived in this study are useful for setting baselines for REDD+ and other emission mitigation programs, and for evaluating the performance of such efforts.","[Song, Xiao-Peng; Huang, Chengquan; Hansen, Matthew C.; Townshend, John R.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Song, Xiao-Peng; Huang, Chengquan; Townshend, John R.] Univ Maryland, Global Land Cover Facil, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Saatchi, Sassan S.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",,"Song, XP (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",xpsong@umd.edu,,,,,,,40,40,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 7,2015.0,10.0,5,,,,,,e0126754,10.1371/journal.pone.0126754,,,,,,,,WOS:000354214400108,

The Millennium Ecosystems Assessment (MA) forecasts the extinction of a large fraction of Amazonian tree species based on projected loss of forest cover over the next several decades.

We use neutral theory to estimate the number, relative abundance, and range size of tree species in the Amazon metacommunity, and estimate likely tree-species extinctions under published optimistic and nonoptimistic Amazon scenarios. We estimate that the Brazilian portion of the Amazon Basin has (or had) 11,210 tree species that reach sizes > 10 cm DBH (stem diameter at breast height). Of these, 3,248 species have population sizes > 1 million individuals, and, ignoring possible climate-change effects, almost all of these common species persist under both optimistic and nonoptimistic scenarios. At the rare end of the abundance spectrum, however, neutral theory predicts the existence of approximate to 5,308 species with < 10,000 individuals each that are expected to suffer nearly a 50% extinction rate under the nonoptimistic deforestation scenario and an approximate to 37% loss rate even under the optimistic scenario. Most of these species have small range sizes and are highly vulnerable to local habitat loss.

However, CBMSs are embedded in local social-ecological systems usually characterized by multiple ruling systems, different local groups, and heterogeneous ecological systems. In this paper I discuss how the floodplain tenure system is negotiated and rearranged between two local groups - community residents and large landholders. This complex and dynamic arrangement comprises three layers of property rights which are combined according to changing ecological and social context. Based on longitudinal empirical data spanning 20 years of research, I describe the history of contemporary human occupation, and the most recent socioeconomic and institutional changes in the region in order to unpack the dynamics of the floodplain tenure in the region. I conclude that assumptions that integration of local management system into a formal legal framework suffices to achieve an efficient co-management system is rather simplistic. Despite major structural changes in the formal tenure framework, power relations between different local users may remain unchanged unless local perceptions and everyday life practices of power relations are changed. Unpacking the multiple ruling systems and everyday life practices that mediate interactions between different local actors is fundamental to understanding how the commons are appropriated at the local level. Therefore, a local contextualization of the social and ecological structure is crucial to reveal potential barriers to the development of an inclusive and sustainable production system.","[de Castro, Fabio] Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Latin Amer Res & Documentat CEDLA, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"de Castro, F (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Latin Amer Res & Documentat CEDLA, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.decastro@cedla.nl,,,,,,,3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,10.0,1,,,,1,20,,10.18352/ijc.472,,,,,,,,WOS:000377762400001,

Such grain size dependency presents a formidable obstacle to routine applications of meteoric cosmogenic Be-10 to basin-wide erosion studies. In this study, we explore means to eliminate these grain size effects in bedload from rivers of the Amazon basin by measuring Be-10/Be-9 ratios after selective chemical extraction of reactive authigenic phases. These phases mainly comprise Fe-Mn-(hydr)oxides that are the main carriers of Be-9 and Be-10. We explore the distribution of Be-10 and its stable Be-9 counterpart between these phases and the partitioning of Be into remaining silicate fractions. This extraction procedure was carried out on bedload samples comprising the three main tectonic units of the Amazon basin, namely the Andes, the Guyana and Brazilian Shields, and the central Amazonian lowlands. For all samples, extracted Be-10 concentrations show a strong decrease with increasing particle size, with up to 20 times more Be-10 extracted from the finest analyzed (<30 mu m) grain size when compared to the coarsest (90-125 mu m) grain size. We attribute this decrease in Be-10 concentrations mostly to subsequent dilution by quartz in coarse bedload. However, when normalized to stable Be-9 concentrations that are also extracted from reactive phases, grain size effects are effectively removed and the resulting reactive Be-10/Be-9 ratio is uniform for all particle sizes. The reactive Be-10/Be-9 ratio thus offers important advantages over methods employing single meteoric Be-10 concentrations, such that this ratio can now be developed as quantitative tracer for Earth surface processes.

Understanding how biodiversity will respond to RIL demands assessments that include interactions among initial site conditions, specific harvest techniques, and responses of species that can be compared across varied forest types and regions. We assessed the short-term effects of RIL on 10 avian species in logged and unlogged portions of two concessions in Acre State, Brazil. We performed 460 point-count surveys and estimated variation in occupancy using a removal model that accounts for imperfect detection. Species were selected to include birds with contrasting expected responses to logging activities. We also conducted vegetation assessments at bird sampling locations, paying particular attention to bamboo (Guadua spp.) structure and distribution due to its dominance in forests of the region and high importance as a habitat component for Amazonian birds. Occupancy of four species varied between RIL and unlogged areas and was highly influenced by the percentage of bamboo present. Overall, bird responses to logging was greater where percent cover of bamboo was highest and, for two species, elevated occupancy was closely associated with elevated bamboo density. Bamboo dominance did not differ between logged and unlogged areas; our analysis indicated that this may have resulted from avoidance of bamboo stands by logging crews. This potential behavior, in turn, insured that bamboo refuges were maintained within logged areas, aiding species otherwise negatively affected by logging. Our work suggested how important logger behavior can be in influencing the structure of wildlife habitat under RIL management and that bird responses to logging, both positive and negative, are strongly influenced by local forest conditions.

Using a panel data set that combines municipal-level deforestation and election data from 2002 to 2012, I estimate the effect of an incumbent mayor running for re-election on deforestation rates in election periods. I find that deforestation rates increase 8-10% in election years when an incumbent mayor runs for re-election, an amount equivalent to four percent of the total forest lost since the 2004 elections. Electoral deforestation cycles do not appear to be driven by changes in agricultural policy implementation and activity, but are linked to corruption and campaign finance, suggesting that weak institutional constraints facilitate electoral manipulation of forest resources. This phenomenon is not likely limited to Amazonian forests; re-election incentives could very well lead to misallocation of other natural resources in alternate geographies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike the eastern Brazilian Amazon, it is still a largely intact ecosystem. Underlying this landscape are large reserves of oil and gas, many yet untapped. The growing global demand is leading to unprecedented exploration and development in the region. Methodology/Principal Findings: We synthesized information from government sources to quantify the status of oil development in the western Amazon. National governments delimit specific geographic areas or blocks'' that are zoned for hydrocarbon activities, which they may lease to state and multinational energy companies for exploration and production. About 180 oil and gas blocks now cover, 688,000 km(2) of the western Amazon. These blocks overlap the most species-rich part of the Amazon. We also found that many of the blocks overlap indigenous territories, both titled lands and areas utilized by peoples in voluntary isolation. In Ecuador and Peru, oil and gas blocks now cover more than two-thirds of the Amazon. In Bolivia and western Brazil, major exploration activities are set to increase rapidly. Conclusions/Significance: Without improved policies, the increasing scope and magnitude of planned extraction means that environmental and social impacts are likely to intensify. We review the most pressing oil- and gas-related conservation policy issues confronting the region. These include the need for regional Strategic Environmental Impact Assessments and the adoption of roadless extraction techniques. We also consider the conflicts where the blocks overlap indigenous peoples' territories.","[Finer, Matt; Ross, Carl] Save Amer Forests, Washington, DC USA; [Jenkins, Clinton N.; Pimm, Stuart L.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC USA; [Keane, Brian] Land Is Life, Somerville, MA USA",,"Finer, M (corresponding author), Save Amer Forests, Washington, DC USA.",matt@saveamericasforests.org,,,,,,,306,315,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 13,2008.0,3.0,8,,,,,,e2932,10.1371/journal.pone.0002932,,,,,,,,WOS:000264412600018,

Using surveys and interviews performed in 2016 as social and quantifiable tools, we determine basic sanitation practices in Altamira after the construction of Belo Monte and reveal issues that can impact the environment and public health of the population. Through analysis of national policies and the use of publicly available information, we identify discrepancies between Altamira's current reality and Brazil's existing national public policies, mainly Brazil's Water Resources Policy and the Federal Sanitation Law. Similar basic sanitation provision and waste disposal practices along the region lead us to believe that, if not addressed, the implementation gaps observed in Altamira are likely to emerge in future hydroelectric development projects currently envisioned throughout the Amazon Basin. As more dams in the Amazonian region are planned, identifying public policy implementation gaps that affect basic sanitation and water resources creates opportunities to anticipate problems that could impinge on the public health needs of residents where such large infrastructure projects will be implemented.","Michigan State Univ, Coll Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, 673 Auditorium Rd, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA; [Gauthier, Cristina] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, 1405 S Harrison Rd,Suite 218, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA",,"Gauthier, C (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, 1405 S Harrison Rd,Suite 218, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.",gauthi79@msu.edu,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2018.0,97.0,,,,,10,21,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.10.001,,,,,,,,WOS:000454467800002,

Decentralized production of energy is necessary, and new decentralized energy technologies based on renewable sources could provide additional income opportunities, decreasing environmental risk along Amazon corridor, and providing clean fuel and electricity. It's necessary that the bioceanic Amazon corridors call for the application of energy systems related to the renewable local resources in coast, mountain and forest. In Peru, firewood is the principal energy source for cooking and heating and this fuel is used in inefficient combustion system that increases the impact on ecosystems. Typical Peruvian biomass source are wood, agricultural residues, agro industrial waste and municipal solid waste. The most obvious it's the availability of agricultural and agro industrial residues that could be used as a biomass fuel source in modern plant to produce electricity.

The study areas, ranging in size from 600 to 10 000 km(2) include communities that practice a range of land uses from small-scale, rotational agriculture to long-term pasture. Carbon emissions from deforestation were estimated based on rates of deforestation derived from Landsat satellite data and published estimates of mature forest biomass. Estimates of carbon uptake by secondary forest regrowth were based on area estimates from the satellite data and biomass estimates from field surveys. Estimates of carbon emissions from the clearance of secondary forest were included. The total carbon emissions were partitioned into that immediately released by biomass burning during clearance and that from subsequent decomposition and burning of felled biomass. A range of net carbon fluxes from secondary forest regrowth and clearance was estimated by extrapolating land-use patterns in each study area to the entire area of deforested landscape in Amazonian Brazil and Bolivia, and by varying average biomass accumulation rate of regrowing forest and fallow period. Over 60 km(2) of forest were cleared from 1988 to 1905 in each of the Brazilian study areas, and over 940 km(2) were cleared from 1986 to 1996 in the Bolivian study area. This resulted in 30-200 Mg C/yr emitted from biomass burning during deforestation. If the carbon that is committed to subsequent burning and decomposition of felled biomass is included, total committed emissions of 75-650 Mg C/yr resulted from deforestation in each study area. The carbon uptake by secondary forests was 33-435 Mg C/yr. However, emissions from the reclearance of secondary forests were nearly as large: 17-365 Mg C/yr. Extrapolation. of these results to the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon suggests that, at the national level, carbon uptake by secondary forests offset less than one-fifth of the carbon emissions from deforestation. Despite differences in land-use pattern, average fallow period, and rate of biomass accumulation used in the extrapolation, net carbon uptake by secondary forests was consistently small when compared to the total emissions from deforestation.","NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Lab Terrestrial Phys, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",,"Steininger, MK (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Lab Terrestrial Phys, Code 923, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",marc@surutu.gsfc.nasa.gov,,,,,,,10,11,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2004.0,14.0,4,,S,,S313,S322,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000223269000025,

This is particularly relevant for the rapidly advancing development frontiers in the Amazon region, where local communities are coming into contact with external players highly interested in their forest resources. This study focuses on understanding how external discourses can restrict the Amazonian communities' options for using their forests, but also how communities can harness these discourses to achieve their own claims and objectives. Empirical evidence from four study areas in the Bolivian, Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon regions is used to show how discourses on sustainable forest management are moulding forestry governance. The conclusion shows that while the discourses used by loggers and development organisations are strongly influencing the way communities manage their forests, some communities are also successfully using these discourses in alliances with environmental organisations to achieve acknowledgment of their demands.

Taking up the recent call to study marketlzation, this is an ethnographic study of on-the-ground practices in experimenting with the REDD+ carbon trading scheme and institutionalizing the REDD+ carbon markets. Focusing on a pilot REDD+ project in the Brazilian Amazon, this article engages the formulation of the technical concept of leakage both in the economic theories of externalities and in the challenging practice of monitoring and calculating leakage. In the economic conceptualization of externalities, leakages are but the new externalities generated by the process of making new markets to internalize the externalities of previous markets. Whereas current debates about carbon leakages are predominantly concerned with the limited capacity of existing technologies for leakage monitoring and calculation, I suggest rethinking the leakage issue in a different rationale: insufficient leakage accounting is an inevitable result of a forever imperfect process of framing in marketization. This article is focused on leakages in carbon markets not only as the subject of my ethnographic inquiry but also as an entry point for my theoretical extrapolation, because leakages have the advantage of making visible the social technological assemblages for marketlzation, exposing the unequal power relations between the various stakeholders and thus opening onto new modalities of market framing and economic theorization.","[Zhang, Shaozeng] Oregon State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Corvalis, OR 97331 USA",,"Zhang, SZ (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Corvalis, OR 97331 USA.",shaozeng.zhang@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2017.0,4.0,1,,,,132,143,,10.1002/sea2.12078,,,,,,,,WOS:000427918300011,

However, the sources and chemical processes contributing to the formation of these particles remain unclear.

To account for organic NPF, we develop a comprehensive model representation of the temperature-dependent formation chemistry and thermodynamics of extremely low volatility organic compounds as well as their roles in NPF processes. We find that pure-organic NPF driven by natural biogenic emissions dominates in the uppermost troposphere above 13 km and accounts for 65 to 83% of the column total NPF rate under relatively pristine conditions, while ternary NPF involving organics and sulfuric acid dominates between 8 and 13 km. The large organic NPF rates at high altitudes mainly result from decreased volatility of organics and increased NPF efficiency at low temperatures, somewhat counterbalanced by a reduced chemical formation rate of extremely low volatility organic compounds. These findings imply a key role of naturally occurring organic NPF in high-altitude preindustrial environments and will help better quantify anthropogenic aerosol forcing from preindustrial times to the present day.","[Zhao, Bin; Shrivastava, Manish; Shilling, John E.; Zaveri, Rahul A.; Gaudet, Brian; Liu, Ying; Fan, Jiwen; Fast, Jerome D.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.; Gordon, Hamish; Schervish, Meredith] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Atmospher Particle Studies, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.; Schervish, Meredith] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Gordon, Hamish] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wang, Jian] Washington Univ, Dept Energy Environm & Chem Engn, Ctr Aerosol Sci & Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Andreae, Meinrat O.] Max Planck Inst Chem, Multiphase Chem Dept, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Andreae, Meinrat O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Andreae, Meinrat O.] King Saud Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Zhao, Chun] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chun] Univ Sci & Technol China, Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Comparat Planetol, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, B; Fast, JD (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",bin.zhao@pnnl.gov; Jerome.Fast@pnnl.gov,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 13,2020.0,117.0,41,,,,25344,25351,,10.1073/pnas.2006716117,,,,,,,,WOS:000642211500008,

A set of four 5-year digital vegetation model maps was created for the 1981-2001 period, using the first components of the principal components analysis of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) multispectral data (Channels 1, 2 and 4). Vegetation and land cover changes are characterized by destruction of primary forests in the north and large-scale broad areas with intensive human activity and vast grasslands expanding from the south. Large-scale soybean production spreading over the central areas and vast herds of cattle in the north can be pointed to as the main causes of vegetation change in these areas. It is shown that 76.1% of the changes in land cover types occur within 30 km of paved and unpaved roads.

A substantial hope resides in the decoupling of Brazil's agricultural sector from deforestation in the Amazon region, in which case expansive agriculture need not imply forest degradation. However, concerns have also been voiced about the potential indirect effects of agriculture. This article addresses these indirect effects for the case of the Brazilian Amazon since 2002. Our work finds that as much as thirty-two percent of deforestation, or the loss of more than 30,000 km(2) of Amazon forest, is attributable, indirectly, to Brazil's soybean sector. However, we also observe that the magnitude of the indirect impact of the agriculture sector on forest loss in the Amazon has declined markedly since 2006. We also find a shift in the underlying causes of indirect land use change in the Amazon, and suggest that land appreciation in agricultural regions has supplanted farm expansions as a source of indirect land use change. Our results are broadly congruent with recent work recognizing the success of policy changes in mitigating the impact of soybean expansion on forest loss in the Amazon. However, they also caution that the soybean sector may continue to incentivize land clearings through its impact on regional land markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we show that a case-control (CC) sampling approach, in which all (or a large fraction of) pixels with the outcome of interest and a subset of the pixels without this outcome are selected, can yield much better inference and prediction than random sampling (RS) if the estimated parameters and probabilities are adjusted with the equations that we provide. More specifically, we show that a CC approach can yield unbiased inference with much less uncertainty when CC data are analyzed with logistic regression models and its semiparametric variants (e.g., generalized additive models). We also show that a random forest model, when fitted to CC data, can generate much better predictions than when fitted to RS data.

Regeneration tends to occur far from roads (included in 78 % of the models) and inside protected areas (included in 38 % of the models), reflecting the processes of land abandonment. Our temporal analysis of model parameters revealed a degree of variation through time (e.g. effectiveness of protected areas rose by 73 %, p < 0.001), but for the majority of parameters there was no significant trend. The degree to which model predictions agreed with observed change was heavily dependent on the year used for calibration (p < 0.001).

This paper analyzes the determinants of land value in an Amazonian frontier settlement. We estimate hedonic price functions to identify factors that affect the value of farm properties in the western Brazilian Amazon. Distance to market explains nearly one-third of the variation in farm value, as predicted by the von Thunen model. After controlling for location relative to the central market and for municipality, we find that investment in the farms (as reflected in the stocking rate of pastures and the establishment of home gardens) has the next largest impact on land value. The value per hectare of land is negatively related to total lot size, suggesting that any economies of scale are outweighed by the cost of accessing remote corners of large properties. We do not find that land values are related to available measures of biophysical factors or to historic or current land use. Our results do not identify any premium for forest cover or for land uses considered to be more sustainable than pasture on the property itself. However, farm values are affected by neighboring land cover, specifically, the extent of barren land. Thus, local knowledge of factors contributing to future productivity. as summarized in land values, confirms that soil exhaustion can lead to a general decline in property values, while investments in a property both as a homestead and as a farm can help sustain frontier settlements.

The development of direct sales networks in remote areas facilitates: (1) additional entrepreneurship, and encourages a progression from necessity to opportunity entrepreneurship; (2) social change in gender norms, including higher level of female empowerment and decision-making within families and communities; and (3) a reconciliation of local and global values on beauty and fashion for customers, leading to stronger brand relationships. By leveraging micro-entrepreneurship, MNCs can compete with local firms, even in rural areas lacking basic infrastructure, to the benefit of communities and individuals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In Brazil, a resurgence of malaria in recent decades paralleled rapid deforestation and settlement in the Amazon basin, yet evidence of a deforestation-driven increase in malaria remains equivocal. We hypothesize an underlying cause of this ambiguity is that deforestation and malaria influence each other in bidirectional causal relationships-deforestation increases malaria through ecological mechanisms and malaria reduces deforestation through socioeconomic mechanisms-and that the strength of these relationships depends on the stage of land use transformation. We test these hypotheses with a large geospatial dataset encompassing 795 municipalities across 13 y (2003 to 2015) and show deforestation has a strong positive effect on malaria incidence. Our results suggest a 10% increase in deforestation leads to a 3.3% increase in malaria incidence (similar to 9,980 additional cases associated with 1,567 additional km(2) lost in 2008, the study midpoint, Amazon-wide). The effect is larger in the interior and absent in outer Amazonian states where little forest remains. However, this strong effect is only detectable after controlling for a feedback of malaria burden on forest loss, whereby increased malaria burden significantly reduces forest clearing, possibly mediated by human behavior or economic development. We estimate a 1% increase in malaria incidence results in a 1.4% decrease in forest area cleared (similar to 219 fewer km(2) cleared associated with 3,024 additional cases in 2008). This bidirectional socioecological feedback between deforestation and malaria, which attenuates as land use intensifies, illustrates the intimate ties between environmental change and human health.","[MacDonald, Andrew J.; Mordecai, Erin A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [MacDonald, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"MacDonald, AJ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; MacDonald, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",andy.j.macdon@gmail.com,,,,,,,53,56,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 29,2019.0,116.0,44,,,,22212,22218,,10.1073/pnas.1905315116,,,,,,,,WOS:000493720200042,

I simulated treefall gaps within a 10-year-old secondary forest established on a clear-cut area, because cut areas may have a greater potential for economic exploitation than areas used for pastures and shifting cultivation. I explored the effects of varying degrees of canopy opening on the growth of plants already established as advanced regeneration. Five intensities of canopy opening were created: total removal (100%), 80-90%, 50-60%, 20-30% and a 0% control. Only trees >5 cm DBH were cut. The established plant community was diverse, and comprised 37 families and 126 species and morpho-species, of which 72% had some use reported in the literature. I found that the canopy opening treatments resulted in very little disturbance to the established seedling and sapling community, with no significant increase in mortality, but had a strong positive effect on their growth. Light levels reaching the understory were increased from 1% of incident photosynthetic active radiation in control plots to 35% in 100% canopy opening plots. During the first year, differences in plant growth were not significant, but by the second year, differential plant growth associated with canopy opening became evident. Most seedlings (51%) grew approximately 25 cm in height, and approximately one quarter grew more than 25 cm. Only 2.6% of the seedlings decreased in height, and 12% did not grow at all. Fifty percent canopy removal resulted in an almost threefold increase in plant height compared to control plots (0.52 +/- 0.4 m and 0.20 +/- 0.2 m, respectively), and was not significantly different from 80 or 100% removal. This indicates that intermediate levels of canopy removal had positive effects and total removal was unnecessary to stimulate the best growth responses. I conclude that regeneration of diverse mature forest can be accelerated under some conditions by partial removal of secondary forest canopy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The moored array consisted of a transect perpendicular to the coast with inner shelf (18 m depth) and midshelf (65 m) moorings and a third mooring near the shelf break, in 100 m of water. To our knowledge, the AMASSEDS moored array includes the first long-term (2 months) moored observations made within the Amazon Plume. The current variability is dominated by two components, semidiurnal cross-shelf currents with peak velocities of 50 to 200 cm/s and vertically sheared subtidal (timescales days to weeks) along-shelf currents. This study focuses on the subtidal flow within the Amazon Plume which is strong and variable with along-shelf currents ranging from -50 cm/s to over 150 cm/s. The variability in the along-shelf current within the plume is wind driven. The relatively weak (<0.5 dyn/cm(2)) along-shelf wind stresses in this region drive strong along-shelf current variability because the Amason Plume is thin and the interfacial drag is weak. However, in the absence of an along-shelf wind stress the plume flow is northwestward at 40 to 80 cm/s, indicating that direct wind forcing does not account for the mean northwestward flow of the Amazon Plume. In the cross-plume direction there is a tendency for the onshore wind stress due to the persistent trade winds to balance the typically offshore buoyancy force and the Coriolis force associated with the wind-driven along-shelf flow. Thus the wind stress is a key factor influencing variability in both the flow and cross-shelf structure of the Amazon Plume in the vicinity of the moored array.","WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST, DEPT PHYS OCEANOG, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA",,,,,,,,,,88,91,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 15,1995.0,100.0,C2,,,,2377,2390,,10.1029/94JC00343,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QK37200006,

These changes permit a reappraisal of phenological patterns of tropical species. I examined spatio-temporal variation in the distribution patterns of an ostensibly sedentary endemic Brazilian flycatcher, the Ash-throated Casiornis (Casiornis fuscus), using both specimen data from museums and sighting records and rich media data from citizen-science initiatives. I found compelling evidence for partial intratropical longitudinal migration to Amazonia and the Cerrado biomes from the species' core range in the semi-desert Caatinga biome and adjacent ecotones. These records from outside of the Caatinga were distributed during the height of the dry season from April to October, although the Caatinga is not entirely vacated at this time. This pattern of partial migration leads to a doubling of the distributional range of Ash-throated Casiornises and strongly suggests that the species is a breeding near-endemic of the Caatinga biome. This pattern was potentially previously not apparent because of significant biases in specimen collection between biomes, giving a false sense of abundance in the Brazilian Amazon.","[Lees, Alexander C.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",,"Lees, AC (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",alexanderlees@btopenworld.com,,,,,,,15,18,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2016.0,87.0,3,,,,251,259,,10.1111/jofo.12159,,,,,,,,WOS:000383685000002,

Measurements were made by the benthic tripod GEOPROBE placed on the seabed in 65 m depth near the base of the deltaic foreset beds from 11 February to 3 March 1990, during the time of rising water and maximum sediment discharge of the Amazon River; and the observations included: hourly measurements of velocity and suspended-sediment concentration at four levels above the seabed; waves and tides; and seabed elevation. Results of the first 14-day period of the time series record indicate that sediment resuspension occurred as a result of tidal currents (91% of the time) and surface gravity waves (46% of the time). Observations of suspended sediment indicated that particle flux in this region is 0.4-2% of the flux measured on the adjacent topset deposits and is directed to the north and landward relative to the Brazilian coast (268 degrees T). Fortnightly variability is strong, with particle fluxes during spring tides five times greater than during neap tides. On the 15th day of the data record, a rapid sedimentation event was documented in which 44 cm of sediment was deposited at the study site over a 14-h period. Evaluation of various mechanisms of mass sediment movement suggests that this event represents downslope migration of fluid muds from the upper foreset beds that were set in motion by boundary shear stresses generated by waves and currents. This transport mechanism appears to occur episodically and may represent a major source of sediment to the lower foreset-bottomset region of the subaqueous delta.","US GEOL SURVEY, MENLO PK, CA 94025 USA; CH2M HILL INC, BELLEVUE, WA 98009 USA",,"Sternberg, RW (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON, SCH OCEANOG, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.",,,,,,,,63,66,,,,,,,,,,,APR-MAY,1996.0,16.0,5-6,,,,697,715,,10.1016/0278-4343(95)00045-3,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UA18400007,

However, Mauss's argument was stuck in the contradictions generated by a strong nature/culture dichotomy. Contemporary dissolutions and revisions of this dichotomy provide the opportunity to return to Mauss. I shall argue that in the case of floodplain dwellers of the Brazilian Amazon, seasonality is constituted by the movements of people and the rhythmic structure of their social activities, which resonate with and respond to periodic changes in their floodplain environment.

I argue that the development of the smallholder economy has not been a linear process, and the diversity of smallholder farming systems and their patterns of wealth accumulation have varied implications for the rate and magnitude of deforestation. However, whilst there are differential impacts of farming practices on deforestation-cattle ranching has a greater impact than cash cropping or subsistence agriculture-the stronger correlate of deforestation is the wealth of the farmers. Wealthier farmers not only tend to deforest more in absolute terms, but also show a slightly greater propensity to deforest whatever their production system. Though cattle production is a key driver of wealth accumulation and thus deforestation, a significant number of smallholders adopt diversified production systems. The main factors explaining the relationship between the farming systems and deforestation were years of residence on the lot, distance of the lot to main market and the amount of day labor hired-and not variables describing household structure.","Jalan CIFOR Situ Gede, CIFOR, Bogor Barat 16115, Indonesia",,"Pacheco, P (corresponding author), Jalan CIFOR Situ Gede, CIFOR, Bogor Barat 16115, Indonesia.",p.pacheco@cgiar.org,,,,,,,40,40,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2009.0,37.0,1,,,,27,41,,10.1007/s10745-009-9220-y,,,,,,,,WOS:000265441000003,

While some scholars believe that large settlements and complex societies were limited to areas with favourable environmental conditions and human disturbance was localized, others propose that social complexity developed regardless of environmental constraints and opportunities and that human disturbance was widespread. In order to understand the extent to which environmental preconditions influenced the development of pre-Columbian societies, research is needed that integrates both environmental reconstructions and archaeological data. The present study explores past human-environment interactions in the Llanos de Moxos (LM) in the Bolivian Amazon. Combining extensive fieldwork and remote sensing image analysis, we reconstruct mid- to late-Holocene fluvial activity in the southeastern LM and the formation of a sedimentary lobe left by the Grande River. The lobe deposition created the conditions for the development of fertile, drained soils. We also show how pre-Columbian inhabitants adapted to the sedimentary lobe and managed to maximize the area of land suitable for agriculture by building a drainage/irrigation infrastructure. Our results provide an interpretative framework for the diversity of archaeological remains in the LM and suggest that people reached high levels of social complexity as a result of two necessary factors: favourable environmental conditions and human ingenuity.","[Lombardo, Umberto] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [May, Jan-Hendrik] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",,"Lombardo, U (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",lombardo@giub.unibe.ch,,,,,,,27,28,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2012.0,22.0,9,,,,1034,1045,,10.1177/0959683612437872,,,,,,,,WOS:000307641500007,

The Amazon rainforest has been subject to particularly high rates of land use change, primarily to cattle pasture. A commonly observed response to cattle pasture establishment in the Amazon is the conversion of soil from a methane sink in rainforest, to a methane source in pasture. However, it is not known how the microorganisms that mediate methane flux are altered by land use change. Here, we use the deepest metagenomic sequencing of Amazonian soil to date to investigate differences in methane-cycling microorganisms and their traits across rainforest and cattle pasture soils. We found that methane-cycling microorganisms responded to land use change, with the strongest responses exhibited by methane-consuming, rather than methane-producing, microorganisms. These responses included a reduction in the relative abundance of methanotrophs and a significant decrease in the abundance of genes encoding particulate methane monooxygenase. We also observed compositional changes to methanotroph and methanogen communities as well as changes to methanotroph life history strategies. Our observations suggest that methane-cycling microorganisms are vulnerable to land use change, and this vulnerability may underlie the response of methane flux to land use change in Amazon soils.","[Meyer, Kyle M.; Klein, Ann M.; Bohannan, Brendan J.

Fourteen extant species and three genera are currently recognized: Congeria contains three species from karst caves along the eastern Adriatic coast and one from the Orinoco River of Venezuela, Dreissena contains six species native to Eastern European rivers and estuaries, and Mytilopsis contains three species from the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and northwestern coast of South America and one from the Tocantins River of Brazil. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies have examined all species except those from South American rivers, and found each genus to be monophyletic with Congeria and Mytilopsis forming a Glade sister to Dreissena. We present the first multilocus phylogeny of Dreissenidae inclusive of South American riverine species. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of a 3085 bp alignment consisting of mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear (18S and 28S) gene regions found Neotropical species to be consistently and strongly supported as sister to all other dreissenids, although incomplete sequencing of the single Orinoco specimen obscured Neotropical monophyly. Our intergeneric relationships are inconsistent with an extensive fossil record suggesting that dreissenids originated in Europe approximately 30 My before dispersing to the Western Hemisphere. Fossil-calibrated analyses indicated that Neotropical dreissenids diverged from European lineages in the mid to late Eocene (similar to 39.3 Ma), and Brazilian and Guiana shield populations diversified during the Oligocene to Miocene. We erect the new genus Rheodreissena for all Neotropical freshwater dreissenids and present haplotype data indicative of at least three species. Widespread anthropogenic alteration of the middle Xingu River and lower Amazon threatens the persistence of these endemic, poorly studied mussels and may facilitate introduction beyond their native range.","[Geda, Susan; Gangloff, Michael] Appalachian State Univ, Biol Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Geda, Susan] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 1600 Garcon Point Rd, Milton, MA 32583 USA; [Lujan, Nathan] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Scarborough, ON, Canada; [Perkins, Michael] North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commiss, Marion, NC USA; [Abernethy, Erin] Oregon State Univ, Integrat Biol Dept, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Sabaj, Mark] Acad Nat Sci, Philadelphia, PA USA",,"Geda, SR (corresponding author), Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 1600 Garcon Point Rd, Milton, MA 32583 USA.",Susan.Geda@myfwc.com,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2018.0,127.0,,,,,1020,1033,,10.1016/j.ympev.2018.07.009,,,,,,,,WOS:000446021300089,

Current knowledge Leads us to believe that work organization is relevant for the sustainability and transformation of these farms. Taking as an example dairy-beef cattle farms in Uruara (Para), this paper aims to produce knowledge on farmers' Labour with the view of guiding future research and development actions. The farms are extensive grassland systems, with Low Levels of inputs, equipment and technology. Most of the tasks (milking, grazing management) are performed manually. A study, based on the quantification of working time shows that most of the activities (milking, pasture management) are carried out exclusively by the family manpower, helped sometimes by wage earners, volunteer workers and farmers' mutual aid. The study reveals the high variability of routine work (from 913 to 3,955 hours per year for milk production) and seasonal work (from 17 to 328 days per year). In order to manage their cattle and pastures, farmers' technical strategies are also very different (time reduction of Labour, control and reduction of the peak work period, modification of manpower). The analysis of their trajectories clearly proves the alterations of the interactions between agricultural and non-agricultural activities, cattle production and working groups. Our contribution confirms that tabour organization must be taken into account to support sustainable changes of these dairy-beef livestock farms. A better organization of work would facilitate the adoption of new techniques and practices. An aim is to investigate ways to rationalize these farmers' tabour, which is characterized by diversified situations.

First, it expands on Cohen's (1985) and Weiler and Davis' (1993) schematic representation of guides' roles by adding an economy sphere to encompass sustainable principles. Second, it examines the congruence between guides' roles and the study's established sustainable tourism criteria by operationalizing the framework with empirical data. Third, it analyzes the guides' population and their organization to identify possible explanations for the ways they conduct their roles. Data for this study were collected in the Municipality of Manaus in the Brazilian Amazon. Questionnaires, interviews and participant observation were applied to a sample of 36 guides, and archival data were studied to determine public sector involvement. The study concludes that guides' contribution to sustainable tourism development is low. They are mainly pathfinders, bringing visitors to sites and local communities, without interpretation that includes the relevance of the Amazon rainforest at local and global levels, and thereby do not address sustainability issues. The shortcomings are attributed to lack of competence in interpretative skills and lack of knowledge about sustainability. Moreover, a suboptimal work organization counteracts professional skills development. Given the potential that guides have to contribute to any destination's sustainability, the paper argues that the research has relevance to other world destinations.","[Pereira, Ester M.; Mykletun, Reidar J.] Univ Stavanger, Norwegian Sch Hotel Management, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",,"Pereira, EM (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Norwegian Sch Hotel Management, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",esterp131@aol.com,,,,,,,27,27,,,,,,,,,,,,2012.0,12.0,1,,,,74,94,,10.1080/15022250.2012.663558,,,,,,,,WOS:000305324200006,

The associations between CMT and occurrence of malaria were examined through multiple linear regression (when the outcome was malaria episode frequency) or Cox regression (when the outcome was time to malaria onset). Poor CMT (prior to baseline) was identified as an important predictor of the occurrence of subsequent malaria episodes during follow-up among individuals with an indication of being less immune - those whose first malaria episode was relatively recent or those who had an increased number of malaria episodes during the last 2 years. Moreover, surprisingly, it seems that for individuals who are probably more immune (individuals who had experienced their first malaria episode more than 4.5 years previously or those with few or no malaria episodes during the last 2 years), CMT was found to be a poor predictor of increased risk of subsequent malaria.

Proposed mechanisms include larger soil water store and deeper roots in nature and the ability of roots to move water up and down (hydraulic redistribution), both absent in the models. Here we provide a first-order assessment of the potential importance of the upward soil water flux from the groundwater driven by capillarity. We present a map of equilibrium water table depth from available observations and a groundwater model simulation constrained by these observations. We then present a map of maximum capillary flux these water table depths, combined with the fine-textured soils in the Amazon, can potentially support. The maps show that the water table beneath the Amazon can be shallow in lowlands and river valleys (<5 m in 36% and <10 m in 60% of Amazonia). These water table depths can potentially accommodate a maximum capillary flux of 2.1 mm day(-1) to the land surface averaged over Amazonia, but varies from 0.6 to 3.7 mm day(-1) across nine study sites. We note that the results presented here are based on limited observations and simple equilibrium model calculations, and as such, have important limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. The potential capillary fluxes are not indicative of their contribution to the actual evapotranspiration, and they are only an assessment of the possible rate at which this flux can occur, to illustrate the power of soil capillary force acting on a shallow water table in fine textured soils. They may over-estimate the actual flux where the surface soils remain moist. Their contribution to the actual evapotranspiration can only be assessed through fully coupled model simulation of the dynamic feedbacks between soil water and groundwater with sub-daily climate forcing. The equilibrium water table obtained here serves as the initial state for the dynamic simulation, and together with the equilibrium potential capillary flux, will serve as a baseline to evaluate the diurnal, event, seasonal and inter-annual dynamics.","[Fan, Y.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA; [Miguez-Macho, G.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Galicia, Spain",,"Fan, Y (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA.",yingfan@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,60,62,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,14.0,10,,,,2039,2056,,10.5194/hess-14-2039-2010,,,,,,,,WOS:000283667500019,
484,4063,J,"Hervas, ID",,,,"De la Villa Hervas, Ismael",,,The production of social space in Brazilian Amazon through hydroelectric dams: The case of Belo Monte's conflict,RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES-MADRID,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"During the last decades in Brazil there has been a sign Kant increase in hydrosocial conflicts due to the construction of large hydroelectric complexes, which involve qualitative and quantitative changes regarding access and ownership of water. It has opened a new period of accumulation and transformation of production relations through the commodification of this important resource.This has seen the extension of large projects of an extractivist nature in the Amazon region, especially from the end of the eighties of last century, after the settlement of the so-called Washington consensus.This phenomenon led to a whole series of transformations in productive, reproductive and social relations, in order to provide mechanisms for regional and national integration, as well as for overcoming accumulation crises emanating from the global scale. In the Brazilian case, these reforms undertaken in recent decades in the political, social, environmental, economic and legislative realms, have not meant a major change in the productive level of the world-economy scale, since the peripheral role of the country, initiated during the colonial period, is still maintained. But they have deepened their dependence through the extractivist development model, highlighting among other practices (such as the advance of the agricultural frontier, large soybean crops, the deployment of fracking to increase income derived from hydrocarbons, etc..) the large hydroelectric complexes located throughout the country's vast hydrographic basin. The main goal of this kind of new structure is to produce higher levels of energy, largely dedicated to the processing of aluminium, whose demand has increased exponentially in recent years in states such as China, among other members of BRICS. From all these hydroelectric structures, probably the one that stands out the most is the Belo Monte dam on the Xingii river, near to the city of Altamira, due it its importance and expansion over time. A multiplicity of actors are involved in this one (indigenous communities, fishing farmers, the State, Eletrobras, non-governmental organizations, indigenous confederations, construction companies, supranational institutions, etc.), and whose dispute over access to water resources implies a modification of the configuration of the power relations that take place in the territory. In spite of the fact that its planning began in 1975, within the framework of the search for a better use of the country's hydroelectric potential and to boost economic development and energy sovereignty, the advances and setbacks in the settlement of the operation of the infrastructure have been delayed until today and probably will continue in the near future.This paper not only aims to analyze the spatio-temporal path of this controversial conflict, but proposes two additional objectives. On the one hand, the elaboration of a theoretical framework that combines the perspectives of the production of nature, the production of space and the construction of scale, which could be applied to the analysis of other environmental conflicts that take place in the global south. On the other hand, and as a consequence of its use in this particular case, it seeks to determine the strengths and weaknesses of this theoretical framework for future similar work. Hitherto the majority of the works and papers related to this case study are focused on the contentious politics of social movements and communities to stop the development of the project A significant number also analyze the contradictions of PT through the Brazilian state regarding the different social impacts of the dam.This article aims to go further and provide tools and categories to explain the practices, relations and structures which are involved this process. In view of this,a methodology based on bibliographic review, and the use of both primary and secondary sources is proposed. Through this method, it is possible to outline the set of practices, representations and relationships that shape the conflict itself. In turn, to achieve this end, the article is divided into four main parts. In the first, an articulation approach is developed between the different categories and aspects of the theoretical gazes for their uses in the case study. In relation with the perspective of the production of nature, originally developed by Neil Smith, the categories of use value and exchange value are fundamental. These, through their dialectic within relations of production, modify through the passing of time the metabolism that takes place between nature and society itself, generating conflicts where these changes imply a clash between two modes of production.With this fact different values prevail over the environmental resources, whose access is sought to continue the process of social reproduction. In addition to this, the proposed framework take in count the categories of spatial practices, representations of space and spaces of representation, formulated by Henri Lefebvre, in order to explain how changes in power relations involve changes in the space in which they are inserted and vice versa Furthermore, with the interscalar perspective proposed by several scholars that are mentioned, the possibility of explaining how phenomena and actors from different scales influence the local one during the long development of the conflict. Subsequently, in the second section of the paper, the analysis of the spatio-temporal development of the conflict is carried out, from the beginning of project planning, through the modifications carried out by the different governments, the changes in the positions of the actors, the different law resolutions, the granting of licenses and so on, until today. Thirdly, the role of hegemonic actors in advancing the construction of the hydroelectric complex is explained and detailed, for which it is not only important to analyze the different representations and narratives carried out by different governments with respect to the project of Belo Monte, but also how state hydroelectric companies (Eletrobras and Betronorte) are affected by the entrance of foreign capital, changing over time the spatial practices that are carried out, as well as the different positions of the institution responsible for the granting of environmental licenses to allow the dam activity (IBAMA).At the end, in the last part, the same operation is made but with the subordinate actors involved, which basically would be the local and foreign non-governmental organizations, as well as the communities of indigenous, peasant and fishermen of the locality. For them, the river fundamentally supposes a use value insofar as it is used as a source of resources and transportation to maintain pre-capitalist production relations on which they are sustained. Obviously these activities have a low exchange value produced through its limited technology to harvesting and fishing, that finally are destined for local trade. The main results which can be highlighted are related with how this dam in particular, and the different hydroelectric projects in general along the region, allow to extend spatially an economic integration through the deployment of new relations of production and mechanisms for accumulation.These ones suppose an appearance of new use values, exchange values and values that clash against the previous ones thus producing the social struggle in the local scale around the dam. Furthermore, the frameworks of the scale and the production of social space show as useful theories for its application to future cases of environmental conflicts, meanwhile the production of nature framework shows some difficulties in order to use some of its categories for the case study.","[De la Villa Hervas, Ismael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Ciencias Polit & Relac Int, Madrid, Spain",,"Hervas, ID (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Ciencias Polit & Relac Int, Madrid, Spain.",ismadela@ucm.es,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT-JAN,2020.0,,45,,,,185,204,,10.15366/relacionesinternacionales2020.45.008,,,,,,,,WOS:000586037200010,

There were no significant differences between soils of these land cover types in terms of plant nutrients (e.g. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mo, Mn, Zn, Cu and Co) or other fertility indicators (OM pH,, BS, EC, CECe and exchangeable acidity). The parent material (as indicated by texture and sample geographical origin) and the slope of the sampled sites were stronger controls on soil fertility than land cover type. Elevated concentrations of a few nutrients (NO3 and K) were, however detected in soils of swidden fields. Despite being fertile (higher CECe, Ca and P) compared to Oxisols and Ultisols in the Amazon lowland, the Subandean soils frequently showed deficiencies in several nutrients (e.g. P, K, NO3, Cu and Zn), and high levels of free Al at acidic sites. This paper concludes that deforestation and agricultural land-use has not introduced lasting chemical changes in the studied Subandean soils that are significant in comparison to the natural variability.

To investigate the impacts of deforestation, we quantified total aboveground biomass (TAGB), aboveground and soil pools of C and N, and soil N availability along a land-Use gradient in Rondonia, Brazil, that included standing primary forest, slashed primary and secondary forest, shifting cultivation, and pasture sites. TAGB decreased substantially with increasing land use, ranging from 311 and 399 Mg ha(-1) (primary forests) to 63 Mg hat (pasture). Aboveground C and N pools declined in patterns and magnitudes similar to those of TAGB. Unlike aboveground pools, soil C and N concentrations and pools did not show consistent declines in response to land use. Instead, C and N concentrations were strongly related to percent clay content of soils. Concentrations of NO3-N and NH4-N generally increased in soils following slash-and-burn events along the land-use gradient and decreased with increasing land use. increasing land use resulted in marked declines in NO3-N pools relative to NH4-N pools. Rates of net nitrification and N-mineralization were also generally higher in postfire treatments relative to prefire treatments along the land-use gradient and declined with increasing land use. Results demonstrate the linked responses of aboveground C and N pools and soil N availability to land use in the Brazilian Amazon; steady reductions in above ground pools along the land-use gradient were accompanied by declines in inorganic soil N pools and transformation rates.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,"Hughes, RF (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, USDA, 23 E Kawili St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.",fhughes@fs.fed.us,,,,,,,52,58,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2002.0,5.0,3,,,,244,259,,10.1007/s10021-001-0069-1,,,,,,,,WOS:000175709800003,

However continued loss and degradation of forested landscapes, coupled with a rapidly rising global population, is placing incredible pressure on forests globally. The United Nations has developed the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +) programme in response to the challenges facing tropical forests and in recognition of the role they can play in climate mitigation. REDD + requires consistent and reliable monitoring of forests, however, national-level methodologies for measuring degradation are often bespoke and, because of an inability to track degradation effectively, the majority of countries combine reporting for deforestation and forest degradation into a single value. Here, we extend a recent analysis that enabled the detection of selective logging at the scale of a logging concession to a regional-scale estimation of selective logging activities. We utilized logging records from across Brazil to train a supervised classification algorithm for detecting logged pixels in Landsat imagery then predicted the extent of logging over a 20 year period throughout Rondonia, Brazil. Approximately one-quarter of the forested lands in Rondonia were cleared between 2000 and 2019. We estimate that 11.0% of the forest area present in 2000 had been selectively logged by 2019, comprising >11 500 km(2)of forest. In general, rates of selective logging were twice as high in the first decade relative to the last decade of the period. Our approach is a considerable advance in developing an operationalized selective logging monitoring system capable of detecting subtle forest disturbances over large spatial scales.","[Hethcoat, M.

Competition for energy resources has already revealed geopolitical fault lines, and the dependence of industrial economies on fossil fuel promises to keep nations on edge. A widespread consensus has emerged that societies must transition to a new energy basis, given that fossil fuel is nonrenewable and its combustion leads to global warming. Although alternatives like nuclear energy and hydropower provide important electrical supplies locally, the search goes on, and recently much attention has focused on biofuel. Although biofuel represents a renewable and ogreeno energy, there is also a downside. This article considers one potential problem, namely, the impact of growing international biofuel demand on Amazonia. The article focuses on Brazil, given the explosive growth of Brazilian agriculture, and notable effects on forests within its national borders. The article seeks to answer this question: How will global demand for Brazil's land-based commodities, including biofuel, impact its tropical forest in the Amazon basin? In attempting to answer this question, the article describes recent agricultural expansion in Brazil and its emergent landscape of renewable energy. Using an adaptation of rent theory, it frames a concept of landscape cascade and shows how Brazil's expanding landscape of renewable energy is impacting forest areas at a great distance. The article then considers recent projections of demand for Amazonian land out to 2020, given growth of Brazilian biofuel production and cattle herds. The projections indicate that more Amazonian land will be demanded than has been made available by Brazilian environmental policy. With this result in mind, the article discusses the discursive dismemberment of Amazonia and how this articulates with efforts by Brazilian politicians to increase the region's land supply. The article points out that agricultural intensification holds the key to meeting global demand without degrading the Amazonian forest, a landscape unique in the world for its ecological and cultural riches.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Walker, R (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, 314 Nat Sci Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",rwalker@msu.edu,,,,,,,21,22,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,101.0,4,,,,929,938,PII 937460050,10.1080/00045608.2011.568885,,,,,,,,WOS:000291495100022,

We present rt-MRI evidence showing a narrow constriction between the tongue dorsum and velum emerging at the end of back nasal vowels, patterning similarly with velar stop consonants. Though our present subject does not show evidence of complete occlusion, we believe the small distance between the tongue dorsum and velum makes the emergence of a velar consonant highly likely.

The impacts of registration varied over time, likely due to changing suites of policies linking environmental registration to land use incentives. Our results also reveal that agriculturally suitable lands and those located in regions undergoing the most land-use change were more likely to be registered than those in less suitable, less dynamic regions.

Basin-wide net land use and land cover changes imply substantially different situations between distinct regions and states due to different agricultural policies. This research used eight landscape metrics to quantify and investigate the spatial patterns of cattle pasture and cropland throughout the states of Pars, Mato Grosso, Rondonia, and Amazonas. These metrics were patch density (DEN), mean patch size (MPS), largest patch index (LP!), mean edge density (MED), mean twist number (TWI), corrected perimeter-to-area ratio (CPA), fractal dimension (FDI), and fragmentation index (FRG). A total of 1852 patches were analyzed, originating from 86 samples in 71 different plots, covering a total of 177,500 km(2) throughout all four states. Principal component analysis showed a partial overlap in the spatial pattern of agricultural patches between all states. The largest percentage of variance was explained by patch area metrics, which can be related to the different approaches in agricultural policies, but no clear division between the states was identified in this dimension. The metrics quantifying patch shape were de facto independent of deforestation area, and related to the second principal component axis. Although some overlap in this dimension was present as well, these metrics proved a possible measure for discerning the patterns of agriculture attached to a certain state. Different land use policies are hypothesized to lead to more heterogeneity in landscape patterns in an early stage, yet the increasing influence of both cropland and pasture agriculture eventually leads to more uniform landscapes in which spatial differences gradually disappear.

Principal methods of framing used also demonstrate how contemporary narratives (e.g. sustainability) have been employed to deflect opposition criticism and widen the scheme's perceived beneficiaries.

Industrially processed samples lost substantial amounts of proanthocyanidins (up to 83.2%), while the anthocyanins inherently present were greatly enriched after processing (20-fold higher). Non-processed acai pulp extracts protected against early inflammation response which was correlated with proanthocyanidins, by significantly inhibiting nitric oxide production and suppressing pro-inflammatory gene expression including interleukin-1 beta, cyclooxygenase-2, nitric oxide synthase, and interleukin-6. The promotion of dermal wound repair of acai seed and pulp extracts was mainly contributed by anthocyanins and other bioactive compounds. The anti-inflammatory effect was diminished but wound healing effect was retained after pulp processing, suggesting the processing technology needs to be improved to maintain biological properties of acai fruit.","[Xiong, Jia; Esposito, Debora] North Carolina State Univ, Plants Human Hlth Inst, Dept Anim Sci, Kannapolis, NC 28081 USA; [Xiong, Jia; Esposito, Debora] North Carolina Stale Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Xiong, Jia; Lila, Mary Ann; Ward, Neil L.] North Carolina State Univ, Plants Human Hlth Inst, Dept Food Biopmcessing & Nutr Sci, Kannapolis, NC USA; [Matta, Fernanda, V; Grace, Mary; Felipe-Sotelo, Monica] Univ Surrey, Dept Chem, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",,"Esposito, D (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Plants Human Hlth Inst, Dept Anim Sci, Kannapolis, NC 28081 USA.; Esposito, D (corresponding author), North Carolina Stale Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",daesposi@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1,2020.0,11.0,6,,,,4903,4914,,10.1039/c9fo03109j,,,,,,,,WOS:000542844600067,

In comparison, the contribution from selective logging to atmospheric CO2 emissions, and its impact on regional C dynamics, is highly uncertain. Using a new geographically based modeling approach in combination with high resolution remote sensing data from 1999 to 2002, we estimate that C emissions were 0.04-0.05 Pg C yr(-1) due to selective logging from a similar to 2,664,960 km(2) region of the Brazilian Amazon. Selective logging was responsible for 15-19% higher carbon emissions than reported from deforestation (clear-cutting) alone. Our simulations indicated that forest carbon lost via selective logging lasts two to three decades following harvest, and that the original live biomass takes up to a century to recover, if the forests are not subsequently cleared. The two-to three-decade loss of carbon results from the biomass damaged by logging activities, including leaves, wood, and roots, estimated to be 89.1 Tg C yr(-1) from 1999 to 2002 over the study region, leaving 70.0 Tg C yr(-1) and 7.9 Tg C yr(-1) to accumulate as coarse woody debris and soil C, respectively. While avoided deforestation is central to crediting rain forest nations for reduced carbon emissions, the extent and intensity of selective logging are also critical to determining carbon emissions in the context of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). We show that a combination of automated high-resolution satellite monitoring and detailed forest C modeling can yield spatially explicit estimates of harvest-related C losses and subsequent recovery in support of REDD and other international carbon market mechanisms.","[Huang, Maoyi] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Huang, Maoyi; Asner, Gregory P.] Carnegie Inst, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Huang, MY (corresponding author), Pacific NW Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",maoyi.huang@pnl.gov,,,,,,,117,126,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 30,2010.0,24.0,,,,,,,GB3028,10.1029/2009GB003727,,,,,,,,WOS:000282433600004,

The aim of the study was to establish Hg exposure in indigenous citizens from the Tarapaca village, Cotuhe and Putumayo Rivers, at the Colombian Amazon. Total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations were measured employing a DMA-80 Hg analyzer. For that purpose, 190 hair samples were taken from volunteers living in different communities of Tarapaca. The overall mean T-Hg level for all samples was 10.6 +/- 0.4 mu g/g, with values ranging from 0.61 to 31.1 mu g/g. The mean T-Hg level decreased in the order Puerto Huila > Puerto Ticuna > Ventura > Nueva Union > Buenos Aires > Santa Lucia > Puerto Nuevo > Cana Brava > Pupuna. Based on recommendations from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), 99.5% of the samples exceeded the maximum level of 1.0 mu g/g. Hg content in human hair was significantly associated with fish consumption (rho = 0.253; p < 0.001). According to the health survey, at least 24.7% of the volunteers manifested some signs and symptoms of Hg poisoning. In short, these data support the extensive Hg exposure in the environment of the Colombian Amazon, a process that could be impacting the quality of life of its vulnerable indigenous groups.

It is essential to accurately measure these fires for robust regional and global modeling of key environmental processes. Here we have explored the link between spatio-temporal variability patterns in the Amazon basin's fires and the resulting smoke loading using 11 years (2002-2012) of data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations. Focusing on the peak burning season (July-October), our analysis shows strong inter-annual correlation between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and two MODIS fire products: fire radiative power (FRP) and fire pixel counts (FC). Among these two fire products, the FC better indicates the amount of smoke in the basin, as represented in remotely sensed AOD data. This fire product is significantly correlated both with regional AOD retrievals from MODIS and with point AOD measurements from the AERONET stations, pointing to spatial homogenization of the smoke over the basin on a seasonal time scale. However, MODIS AODs are found better than AERONET AODs observation for linking between smoke and fire. Furthermore, MODIS AOD measurements are strongly correlated with number of fires similar to 1(0)-2(0) to the east, most likely due to westward advection of smoke by the wind. These results can be rationalized by the regional topography and the wind regimes. Our analysis can improve data assimilation of satellite and ground-based observations into regional and global model studies, thus improving the assessment of the environmental and climatic impacts of frequency and distribution variability of the Amazon basin's fires. We also provide the optimal spatial and temporal scales for ground-based observations, which could be used for such applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, logged tropical forest represents critical strongholds of global biodiversity. The ability of these forests to rapidly recover their baseline thermal environmental conditions will markedly influence their conservation value, particularly under global climate change. We investigated the impacts of commercial selective logging on the forest thermal environment in the Brazilian Amazon by relating canopy disturbance from logging to ambient understorey and ground surface temperatures. Specifically, we assessed the impact of selective logging on the forest thermal heterogeneity; how much post-harvest time is required for the thermal environment of logging gaps and logging roads return to unlogged primary forest levels; and the spatial availability of surface microclimates considering time of recovery since logging. Logging gaps following 1 year of recovery had a hotter understorey ambient than all other environments, especially during peak midday temperatures. Compared to the unlogged understorey, logging gaps after 3 years of recovery were only marginally warmer, and logging gaps after 5 years of recovery were slightly cooler. Older wide roads (5 years; 6 m) experienced very similar understorey thermal conditions than both narrow roads (3 m) after 1-5 years of recovery, and unlogged forest. Ground surface temperatures exhibited the largest discrepancies among all environments. The temperature range spanned by surface microclimates notably increased during peak midday heat in logging gaps following 1 year of recovery. Additionally, the proportion of cool area was smaller in younger logging gaps, but the average size of cool patches and their spatial aggregation was similar to that in unlogged forest. Although commercial selective logging can severely damage tropical forest structure, we found that the forest can fairly rapidly regain its thermal environment. Post-logging forest management should carefully focus on preventing fire incursions and illegal activities with special attention to those 3-5 years post-harvest. Thermal homeostasis in selectively logged tropical forests can be vital for long-term maintenance of global biodiversity under contemporary scenarios of climate change.","[Mollinari, Manoela M.; Edwards, David P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Peres, Carlos A.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",,"Mollinari, MM (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",m.m.mollinari@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 15,2019.0,278.0,,,,,,,107637,10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.107637,,,,,,,,WOS:000500196400002,

More recently, the Amazon has suffered extensive deforestation in favor of cattle ranching and other modern systems of agriculture. Cattle pastures, mechanized agriculture, and even tree plantations have detrimental effects on bird communities, greatly lowering diversity, especially that of primary forest interior specialists. A rising threat to the Amazon is the spread of oil palm plantations that retain few bird species and are not viable alternatives to forest. Embedded within the expanding agropastoral mosaic are forest fragments that have experienced a well-documented loss of diversity. Yet, the matrix can mitigate the recovery of fragmented bird communities depending on the type of secondary regrowth. Connectivity via matrix habitats or forest corridors is critical for the maintenance of forest avifauna. With so many types of land use developing across the Amazon, the tropical countryside has potential value for bird diversity. However, evidence suggests that the agropastoral mosaic harbors a small, more homogenized avifauna with few forest species, especially when primary forest is absent from the landscape.

This paper aims to investigate whether black carbon is additionally stabilised by organo-mineral complexation. For this purpose black carbon was analysed in density fractions using benzenecarboxylic acids as molecular markers. Density fractions were also studied by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Concentrations and total amounts of black carbon were generally highest in the light fraction indicating that a major part of black carbon is not chemically stabilised but intrinsically refractory. On the other hand, a large part of black carbon was also found in the heavier fractions, where it was partly embedded within plaques of iron and aluminium oxides on mineral surfaces. The major part of black carbon in the medium fraction seemed to be organo-mineral complexed because we found amounts of black carbon in this fraction by wet chemical analysis but not by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The spectroscopic analysis can only detect particulate black carbon. Black carbon was particularly enriched in 30-40 cm soil depth, and in all fractions of Terra Preta soils compared to adjacent Oxisols. The occurrence of particulate black carbon together with potsherds in the subsoil horizons of Tetra Preta soils indicate that this might be due to turbation processes or the soils were covered by earthworm or termite activities.

This makes them susceptible to reproductive decline in fragmented forest because many of these mutualists suffer area-related extinction in fragments. It remains unknown, however, whether this highly biodiverse tree flora will reproduce and ultimately persist in fragmented forest. We conducted a 2-yr study of seed fall in an experimentally fragmented, highly diverse Central Amazonian forest. We determined the effect of fragment size (1, 10, 100 ha and continuous forest control) on the density, species richness, functional diversity and functional composition of seeds separated into two data sets: dispersed tree seeds, and undispersed tree seeds. Our results show a 3x reduction in the density of undispersed, non-pioneer tree seeds in fragments of all sizes, indicating reduced seed production of the non-pioneer tree community. The density of dispersed tree seeds was reduced by 6x in fragments of all sizes, while species richness was reduced by 6x in 1-ha fragments and by 3x in 10- and 100-ha fragments compared to intact forest. This provides evidence of reduced community-wide seed dispersal, which became more pronounced with declining fragment size. The functional diversity (FRic) of dispersed tree seeds was reduced 9.6x in small fragments, and significant shifts in the functional composition for 8 of the 10 reproductive and ecological traits studied were identified, suggesting compromised ecosystem functioning. These functional compositional shifts provide evidence for disrupted mutualistic processes in fragments, which include loss of pollination by bees, especially small eusocial (meliponid) bees, and loss of dispersal by primates and large birds, which reduced the frequency of large-seeded tree species. Fragments also lost rare and mature-forest species, and collectively these changes suggest that future tree communities in fragmented Amazonian landscapes will retain a taxonomically and functionally impoverished species pool with a biased functional composition unless efforts are undertaken to conserve dispersal by large frugivores and pollination by meliponid bees.","[Hooper, Elaine R.; Ashton, Mark S.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 360 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",,"Hooper, ER (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 360 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",elaine.hooper@aya.yale.edu,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2020.0,30.0,5,,,,,,,10.1002/eap.2093,,MAY 2020,,,,,,WOS:000535306600001,

Women breastfed 10.6 +/- 3.1, 9.4 +/- 3.4, and 9.6 +/- 5.5 times per 9-h period in the three rounds, respectively. Breastfeeding structure, specifically session duration, changed over time (P < 0.05). As lactation progressed, women spent less time breastfeeding and in infant care and more time in subsistence work. In peak lactation, subsistence work was negatively correlated with infant care (r = -0.4, P = 0.01), breastfeeding (r = -0.29, P = 0.05) and session duration (r = -0.39, P < 0.01) and in late lactation was negatively correlated with time spent breastfeeding (r = -0.39, P < 0.01) and in infant care (r = -0.50, P < 0.01) and positively correlated with inter-session interval (r = 0.40, P < 0.01). Generally, women reduced time in subsistence work when breastfeeding was more intense and returned to normal activity patterns once infants were being supplemented. The costs and benefits associated with women's strategies are discussed. Am J Phys Anthropol 144:226-237, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","[Piperata, Barbara A.; Mattern, Lindsey M.

We found that, on average, $979 is forgone in annual livestock, timber, and grain revenues to conserve 1 hectare of forest.

Although much recent effort has focused on the location, effects, and causes of deforestation and cerrado conversion, much less is known about the basin-wide spatial distribution and density of the land use following conversion for crops or pasture. In this paper, we use census and satellite records to develop maps of the distribution and abundance of major agricultural land uses across 4.5 x 10(8) ha of Brazilian Amazonia in 1980 and 1995. Results indicate an overall expansion of 7.0 x 10(6) ha in total agricultural area in Brazilian Amazonia between 1980 and 1995. The net change during this period is estimated for three different land-use types: croplands (an increase of 0.8 x 10(6) ha), natural pastures (a decrease of 8.4 x 10(6) ha), and planted pastures (an increase of 14.7 x 10(6) ha). These estimates, the first spatially explicit quantifications of agricultural land-use activities in 1980 and 1995 across Brazilian Amazonia, are shown to be consistent with the results of applying a land use change and secondary regrowth model to published deforestation rates for the period. The resulting time slices, presented for each land-use category at 5-min (similar to9 km) spatial resolution, allow for the quantification of land-use changes in this region for biogeochemical, demographic and economic models. Several foci of agricultural change existed within Brazilian Amazonia during this period: in the state of Pari, cropland was lost and planted pasture increased markedly; in Mato Grosso, both cropland and planted pasture increased; in Rondonia, planted pasture replacing forest was the primary route to agricultural expansion.

The Planafloro Community Initiative Projects, sponsored by the World Bank from 1995-1998, had powerful effects on politics, increasing electoral support for the Left in the 1998 presidential race. In this paper, we test whether those effects diffuse across space. Using Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA), we find that the diffusion of political change is constrained by infrastructure: political change diffuses from one municipality to the next only when connected by a major highway-an important distinguishing feature in landscapes with difficult terrain. From a methodological standpoint, the study demonstrates the importance of contextual knowledge when performing ESDA. From a practical standpoint, Our results imply that programs designed to diffuse information or program benefits in developing areas operate under important physical geographic and infrastructural constraints.

In 2010, the Peruvian Ministry of Environment launched the National Forest Conservation Program for Climate Change Mitigation, an innovative approach to maintaining forest cover of over 54 million hectares of land in protected areas and indigenous and peasant communities. A key component is a payments for environmental services scheme encouraging investments in sustainable land and forest uses in community-controlled territories. We conducted an ex-ante assessment of how the program would play out in terms of conservation cost-effectiveness, income effects and distributional (equity) outcomes if payments were up-scaled, as intended, to all native communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Our spatially explicit impact assessment relied on remotely sensed deforestation data and field data-supported estimates of conservation opportunity costs. We found that the spatially heterogeneous distribution of forestland and economic returns to multiple land uses across communities results in important tradeoffs between hypothetical cost-effectiveness, poverty alleviation and equity outcomes. Nevertheless, our scenario analyses suggested that alternative design options for payment schemes could improve both cost-effectiveness and equity outcomes simultaneously.","[Boerner, Jan; Giudice, Renzo] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Boerner, Jan; Wunder, Sven] CIP, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Ave La Molina 1895, La Molina, Peru; [Giudice, Renzo] Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GmbH, Prolongac Arenales 801, Lima, Peru",,"Borner, J (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.; Borner, J (corresponding author), CIP, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Ave La Molina 1895, La Molina, Peru.",jborner@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,11,12,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2016.0,43.0,4,,,,407,416,,10.1017/S0376892916000229,,,,,,,,WOS:000387551700012,

These techniques included reliance on natural forest regeneration, mixed commercial species plantings of mostly exotic timber trees, direct seeding with mostly native early successional tree species, and mixed native species plantings of more than 70 tree species (the current operational restoration treatment at this site). Replicated fixed-radius plots in each treatment and in undisturbed primary forest were used to quantify the canopy and understory structure and the abundance and diversity of all vascular plant species. Treatment comparisons considered regeneration density, species richness and diversity for all floristic categories, and, for trees and shrubs, the relative contribution of initial planting; and subsequent regeneration from soil seed banks and seed inputs from nearby primary forests. With the possible exception of the stands of mixed commercial species, which were superior to all others in terms of tree basal-area development but relatively poor in species richness, all treatments were structurally and: floristically diverse, with a high probability of long-term restoration success. Of these, the mixed native species plantings appeared to be at least risk of ar rested succession due to the dominance of a broader range of tree species of different successional stages or expected life spans. In all treatments, several locally important families of primary forest trees (Annonaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae, Palmae and Sapotaceae) were markedly underrepresented due to a combination of poor survival of initial plantings and limitations on seed dispersal from the surrounding primary forest.","US Forest Serv, Int Inst Trop Forestry, Rio Piedras, PR 00928 USA",,"Parrotta, JA (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Int Inst Trop Forestry, POB 25000, Rio Piedras, PR 00928 USA.",,,,,,,,127,144,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,1999.0,7.0,2,,,,103,116,,10.1046/j.1526-100X.1999.72001.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000081034100001,

Based on 80 case studies and interviews with 112 forestry professionals from Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador, the paper characterizes the economic, environmental and structural implications, and identifies the respective financial costs and benefits. Six case studies provided data for in-depth financial analyses. The results showed that the expectations of externally promoted smallholder tree and agroforestry plantations were not met. Despite significant inputs, smallholders generated at best annual net incomes of US$200-$1,000 per ha from NTFP plantations, and up to US$800-$1,000 from timber plantations in the year of harvest. This corresponded to around one-third of the initially expected returns. Overall, only around 1% of the smallholders participating in such initiatives managed to produce and commercialize any plantation products. Smallholders' practices of complementary tree growing in conjunction with agriculture and managing natural regeneration of timber and NTFP products were often underestimated by professionals. They required low input, didn't rely on external support, were highly flexible in risky environments, and some presented financial returns comparable to some well functioning plantations.","[Hoch, L.; Pokorny, B.] Univ Freiburg, Inst Silviculture, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [de Jong, W.] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Integrated Area Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",,"Hoch, L (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Silviculture, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",lisahoch@web.de; benno.pokorny@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de; wdejong@cias.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,24,24,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2012.0,84.0,3,,,,361,375,,10.1007/s10457-012-9480-1,,,,,,,,WOS:000301241700004,

Using these time-series of near annual data from 1973-2011 for an area north of Manaus (in Amazonas state), from 1984-2010 for south of Santarem (Parastate) and 1984-2011 near Machadinho d'Oeste (Rondonia state), the changes in the area of primary forest, non-forest and secondary forest were documented from which the age of regenerating forests, periods of active land use and the frequency of forest reclearance were derived. At Manaus, and at the end of the time-series, over 50% of regenerating forests were older than 16 years, whilst at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste, 57% and 41% of forests respectively were aged 6-15 years, with the remainder being mostly younger forests. These differences were attributed to the time since deforestation commenced but also the greater frequencies of reclearance of forests at the latter two sites with short periods of use in the intervening periods. The majority of clearance for agriculture was also found outside of protected areas. The study suggested that a) the history of clearance and land use should be taken into account when protecting deforested land for the purpose of restoring both tree species diversity and biomass through natural regeneration and b) a greater proportion of the forested landscape should be placed under protection, including areas of regrowth.","[Carreiras, Joao M.

Although state-directed colonization projects are strongly implicated in recent environmental and social changes in the Brazilian Amazon, areas settled by private colonization were larger than state-led settlement. The paper considers this poorly examined aspect of the region's recent settlement history by focusing upon a colonization cooperative and private company that settled smallholders from southern Brazil to eastern Mato Grosso State between 1970 and 1980. The analysis emphasizes how private colonization cooperatives successfully secured land title, setting the stage for subsequent commercial agricultural development. This study rejects prevailing interpretations of private colonization as a tool of authoritarian government in Brazil. Rather, private colonization secured land tenure and organized an economically viable production system in a frontier environment of unpredictable state bureaucracies, high transaction costs, risk, and precarious markets.

Using farm-level survey data from the Brazilian Amazon, I estimate a production function to assess the value of forest fallow and test whether it provides local externalities to agricultural production. Soil quality controls, instrumental variables, and spatial econometric approaches help address endogeneity issues. I use GIS data on external forest cover at the farm level and model the hydrological externality as an upstream-to-downstream process. The estimated parameters indicate that fallow contributes significantly to productivity both on farm and downstream. In addition, most farms allocate sufficient land to fallow, accounting for both the value of hydrological spillovers and the opportunity cost of land left out of cultivation. These results suggest that farming communities may have some self-interest in preserving forest cover locally-a finding that may bolster policy efforts aimed at conserving tropical forests for their global public goods.

The 30 years since colonization (1971) have been marked by a net loss of forest cover and an increase in the amount of cultivated/productive land, particularly for pasture and annual/perennial crop production. This research presents a parcel-level model of landcover change for smallholders in the Altamira study area. The utility of specific land-use activities is calculated to identify those land-uses that are most optimal at each time point, and labor is allocated to these activities based on the availability of household and wage labor. The model reports the proportion of the parcel in the following landcover classes at each time point using a 1-year interval: mature forest, secondary successional forest, perennial crops, annual crops and pasture. A graphical user interface is used for scenario testing, such as the impact of high/low (population) fertility, the increase of out-migration to urban areas, or changes in cattle and crop prices. The model shows a rapid reduction in the amount of mature forest in the 30 years following initial settlement, after which the parcel is composed of a mosaic of secondary succession, pasture and crops. The nature and rapidity of this landcover change is the function of a variety of household and external variables incorporated in the model. In particular, the model produces different landcover compositions as a function of demographic rates (fertility, mortality) and agricultural prices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The parasites are mostly diagnosed by conventional microscopy-based techniques; however, their limitations have led to under-registering the reported prevalence of Plasmodium species. This study has thus been aimed at evaluating the infection and coinfection prevalence of 3 species of Plasmodium spp., in an area of the Colombian Amazon region. Blood samples were taken from 671 symptomatic patients by skin puncture; a nested PCR amplifying the 18S ssRNA region was used on all samples to determine the presence of P. vivax, P. malariae and P. falciparum. Statistical analysis determined infection and coinfection frequency; the association between infection and different factors was established. The results showed that P. vivax was the species having the greatest frequency in the study population (61.4%), followed by P. malariae (43.8%) and P. falciparum (11.8%). The study revealed that 35.8% of the population had coinfection, the P. vivax/P. malariae combination occurring most frequently (28.3%); factors such as age, geographical origin and clinical manifestations were found to be associated with triple-infection. The prevalence reported in this study differed from previous studies in Colombia; the results suggest that diagnosis using conventional techniques could be giving rise to underestimating some Plasmodium spp. species having high circulation rates in Colombia ( particularly in the Colombian Amazon region). The present study's results revealed a high prevalence of P. malariae and mixed infections in the population being studied. The results provide relevant information which should facilitate updating the epidemiological panorama and species' distribution so as to include control, prevention and follow-up measures.","[Andrea Camargo-Ayala, Paola; Ricardo Cubides, Juan; Hernando Nino, Carlos; Camargo, Milena; Quinones, Teodulo; Sanchez-Suarez, Lizeth; Elkin Patarroyo, Manuel; Alfonso Patarroyo, Manuel] Fdn Inst Inmunol Colombia FIDIC, Mol Biol & Immunol Dept, Carrera 50 26-20, Bogota, Colombia; [Elkin Patarroyo, Manuel] Univ Nacl Colombia, Sch Med, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia; [Camargo, Milena; Alfonso Patarroyo, Manuel] Univ Rosario, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Carrera 24 63C-69, Bogota, Colombia; [Arturo Rodriguez-Celis, Carlos] Gobernac Amazonas, Calle 10 10-77, Leticia, Colombia",,"Patarroyo, MA (corresponding author), Fdn Inst Inmunol Colombia FIDIC, Mol Biol & Immunol Dept, Carrera 50 26-20, Bogota, Colombia.; Patarroyo, MA (corresponding author), Univ Rosario, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Carrera 24 63C-69, Bogota, Colombia.",mapatarr.fidic@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,26,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 28,2016.0,11.0,7,,,,,,e0159968,10.1371/journal.pone.0159968,,,,,,,,WOS:000381516100079,

A systematic review and a meta-analysis for the Amazon,IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY,,,,Review,,,,,,,,"Tropical forests are being destroyed to make space for agricultural activities with the assumption that they are required to feed the growing global population. Consequently, more sustainable practices are needed to guarantee food security and environmental protection of highly threatened natural biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon rainforest. Cattle ranching and soybean cultivation are by far the greater drivers of land use change and deforestation in the Amazon region. We performed a systematic review of papers related to these two main drivers and a meta-analysis on the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. The results of the review highlight a large concern about the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops on the ecosystem dynamics and functionality of the Amazon biome, in addition to the clear relationship with deforestation. Another relevant finding is the large gap in empirical research concerning the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. Such a gap is evident since only 13 studies from the initial database met the requirements for a meta-analysis. Of the 171 comparisons between the ecosystem services provided in conventional land-uses and those adopting sustainable practices, the overall model indicated a non-significant effect, although the results were heterogeneous. Crop yield and herbage biomass were negatively affected, while livestock productivity, soil organic carbon, soil fertility and woody biomass were positively affected. Also, the six sustainable practices evaluated showed different outcomes, from a predominance of positive effects in silvopastoral systems, to a predominance of negative effects on agrosilvicultural systems. Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that cattle ranching and soybean cultivation can indeed be conducted in a more sustainable way, enhancing the provision of ecosystem services while avoiding deforestation. In turn, our results also highlight the lack of empirical data and the need to standardize the methodologies used to deeply assess the effects of such practices. In conclusion, we suggest a way to advance research into the real effects of sustainable practices aimed at reducing the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops in the Amazon.","[Bueno, R. da Silveira] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forest Sci SAAF, Palermo, Italy; [Marchetti, L.; Cocozza, C.; Salbitano, F.] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, Florence, Italy; [Marchetti, M.] Univ Molise, Lab Global Ecol, Dept Biosci & Terr, Pesche, IS, Italy",,"Marchetti, L (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, Florence, Italy.",livia.marchetti@unifi.it,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2021.0,14.0,,,,,285,298,,10.3832/ifor3779-014,,,,,,,,WOS:000661736100001,

In Rondonia, Brazil, such burning is restricted to a brief period in the dry season of August and September to minimize the duration of air quality impacts and to attempt to control escaped fires. During this period, much of the region and the communities within it experience significant exposure to smoke from agricultural and forest fires. In cooperation with Brazilian scientists of the University of Brasilia, the Brazilian Organization for Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA), and the Alternative to Slash and Burn Program coordinated by the International Center for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF), ambient air quality was measured in Theobroma, a small town in Rondonia, during one week of the open burning period of 1995 to supplement available air quality data and to foster public awareness of the impacts of widespread fires. Personal sampling equipment was used to measure ambient levels of formaldehyde (HCHO), acrolein, CO, benzene, and respirable PM in outdoor air. The data obtained were compared with established Brazilian and U.S. ambient air quality guidelines. Ambient levels of respirable PM averaged 191 mug/m(3), HCHO averaged 12.8 ppb, CO averaged 4.2 ppm, and benzene averaged 3.2 ppb. Almost all acrolein samples were less than the detection limit of 1 ppb. The results showed that the public can be exposed to relatively high levels of pollutants under the prescribed burning smoke management strategy of a two-to three-week prescription burning period, although this is an improvement over past years when burning was unregulated and continued through most of the dry season. The results also demonstrate the feasibility of using personal exposure monitoring equipment for low-cost surveys of ambient air quality in polluted regions.","URS Corp, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; Univ Pacifico, Programa Agron Trop Humedo, Buenaventura, Colombia",,"Reinhardt, TE (corresponding author), URS Corp, 1501 4th Ave,Suite 1500, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",,,,,,,,34,36,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2001.0,51.0,3,,,,443,450,,10.1080/10473289.2001.10464280,,,,,,,,WOS:000167521500015,

These plants will have a total installed capacity of 44 GW, 9000 km(2) of reservoir area, and a total cost of US$ 30-70 billion. In this paper we aim to evaluate alternative generation pathways to avoid the adverse social and environmental impacts associated with reservoirs in the Amazon. Specifically we model the Brazilian electricity network under five capacity expansion scenarios. We assumed the government expansion plans as the baseline and created alternative scenarios where wind and natural gas power plants replace large Amazonian hydropower plants. We compared the scenarios using several performance indicators: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, capital and operational costs, wind curtailments, and energy storage in the hydropower reservoirs. The simulations suggest that a more aggressive policy towards wind generation than the baseline has the potential to replace Amazon hydropower providing advantages to the system operation (e.g., higher storage in hydropower reservoirs). However, when installedwind capacity reaches 24% to 28% of the total installed capacity, more thermal generation is required to balance the hydro-wind variability, increasing the operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions compared to the baseline.

A recently developed Spectral Variability Vegetation Index (SVVI) is tested to discriminate land cover types with differing tree cover amounts. Random Forest classifier (RF) is applied to inputs from a) spectral mixture analysis (SMA), and b) tasselled cap (TC) transformation, both with and without SSVI as an additional input feature. SVVI improved the classification accuracy from 73% (TC) to 85% (TC-SVVI), and TC-SVVI yielded a land cover map with higher accuracy than that from SMA-SVVI (82%). Pasture-with-trees, secondary forest and primary forest were all distinguishable with the SVVI. Pasture-with-trees accounted for 67% of all pastures, demonstrating its importance for regional land cover.

The Para-Maranhao and Amazon segments consist of exhumation domains and their transition to ocean crust. Their structural styles indicate that this is a magma-poor passive margin with oceanic crust formed in a slow spreading centre. The Para-Maranhao segment is bounded by two branches of the Saint Paul Fracture Zone that displace crustal domains with structures that document the transition from the distal part of a transform margin to an oceanic fracture zone. Two groups of post-rift volcanic complexes have been identified in the exhumation and oceanic domains, and whose distribution is controlled by the fracture zones.

However, few studies to date have systematically examined these effects at the scale of the Amazon Basin, over an entire burning season, using available data sets. We empirically study the relationships of aerosol optical depth (tau(a)) versus rainfall and cloud properties measured from satellites over the entire Brazilian Amazon during the dry, biomass burning seasons ( August - October) of 2000 and 2003. Elevated tau(a) was associated with increased rainfall in both 2000 and 2003. With enhanced tau(a), cloud cover increased significantly, and cloud top temperature/pressure decreased, suggesting higher cloud tops. The cloud droplet effective radius (R-e) exhibited minimal growth with cloud height under background levels of tau(a), while distinct increases in R-e at cloud top temperatures below - 10 degrees C, indicative of ice formation, were observed with aerosol loading. Although empirical correlations do not unequivocally establish the causal link from aerosols, these results are consistent with previous observational and modeling studies that pointed to dynamical effects from aerosols that invigorate convection, leading to higher clouds, enhanced cloud cover, and stronger rainfall. We speculate that changes in precipitation and cloud properties associated with aerosol loading observed in this study could have important radiative and hydrological effects on the Amazonian climate system. The accelerated forest burning for agricultural land clearing and the resulting enhancements in aerosols and rainfall may even partially account for the observed positive trend in Amazonian precipitation over the past several decades.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,"Lin, JC (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Earth Sci, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",jcl@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,161,177,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 12,2006.0,111.0,D19,,,,,,D19204,10.1029/2005JD006884,,,,,,,,WOS:000241297000001,

Models of agricultural production and income diversity indicate that agricultural diversity primarily reflects labor endowments, though certain types of capital are also important. These findings bear implications for research on agricultural diversity in other contexts, and for policies aiming to promote 'productive conservation' by compatibilizing poverty reduction, economic development and environmental sustainability.","Univ Florida, Dept Sociol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Perz, SG (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Sociol, 3219 Turlinginton Hall,POB 117330, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",sperz@soc.ufl.edu,,,,,,,14,14,,,,,,,,,,,,2005.0,63.0,3,,,,263,279,,10.1007/s10457-005-4164-8,,,,,,,,WOS:000226929400007,

Regional markets for non-timber forest products (NTFPs) could both help rural people generate income from forests and raise urban awareness of forest benefits. We assess the urban market for NTFPs in Belem do Para, the largest metropolitan area in the Brazilian Amazon, through a survey of consumers in 2006 - 2009. We segmented the urban consumer market in order to explore patterns in consumption and knowledge about NTFPs. We find that the market segments that consume the greatest number of NTFPs were characterized by relatively higher income and education as well as more recent migration to Belem. This suggests that demand for non-timber forest products does not fade with improved socioeconomic status. However, environmental education is needed to convert this demand into recognition of the benefits provided by forests, as many consumers are not aware that the products they consume come from the forest. In the two largest consumer segments, most consumers could not spontaneously list any forest product they consume, even though when a list of NTFPs was presented, many (>75%) indicated that they did consume the two most popular forest products: acai palm fruit (Euterpe oleraceae) and Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa). Consumers in these largest segments have lower incomes, are more likely to have been born in Belem and are less likely to have completed postsecondary education. In addition to not recognizing that they consume forest products, many of these consumers had no direct experience of the forest: less than half of the survey respondents in these segments reported that they had ever visited the forest, despite living in a city located in the midst of the largest tropical forest in the world.","[Vuola, Matleena; Sills, Erin O.] North Caroline State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Bauch, Simone C.] Global Canopy Programme, Oxford, England",,"Sills, EO (corresponding author), North Caroline State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",sills@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2018.0,48.0,,,,,498,511,,10.5380/dma.v48i0.58685,,,,,,,,WOS:000454644400024,

We assessed the utility of a hybrid classification technique, iterative guided spectral class rejection (IGSCR), for accurately mapping Amazonian deforestation using annual imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) from 1992 to 2002. The mean overall accuracy of the 11 annual classifications was 95% with a standard deviation of 1.4%, and z-score analysis revealed that all classifications were significant at the 0.05 level. The IGSCR thus seems inherently suitable for monitoring forest cover in the Amazon. The resulting classifications were sufficiently accurate to assess preliminarily the magnitude and causes of discrepancies between farmer-reported and satellite-based estimates of deforestation at the household level using a sample of 220 farms in Rondonia mapped in the field in 1992 and 2002. The field- and satellite-derived estimates were significantly different only at the 0.10 level for the 220 farms studied, with the satellite-derived deforestation estimates 8.9% higher than estimates derived from in situ survey methods. Some of this difference was due to a tendency of farmers to overestimate the amount of forest within their property in our survey. Given the objectivity and reduced expense of satellite-based deforestation monitoring, we recommend that it be an integral part of household-level analysis of the causes, patterns and processes of deforestation.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Environm Design & Planning Program, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",,"Wynne, RH (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",wynne@vt.edu,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,,2007.0,28.0,6,,,,1299,1315,,10.1080/01431160600928609,,,,,,,,WOS:000245076800014,

We used long-term plots established in multiple land use types in the Brazilian Amazon to examine the effect of land use change on soil fungal communities. We measured fungal richness and composition and identified factors associated with shifts in community composition across multiple land use types, including primary forest, two secondary forests and a chronosequence of differently aged pastures. Additionally, we used distribution patterns to estimate the niche breadth of fungal taxa in order to quantify changes in the relative abundance of generalists, or fungi with broad environmental tolerance, in response to land use change. Conversion of primary forest to pasture resulted in large reductions in fungal richness coupled with substantial changes in community composition. Generalist fungi were strongly favoured in all pasture sites, regardless of time since conversion. Distance to primary forests was the strongest correlate of community composition in pastures, indicating that primary forests can act as reservoirs for recolonization by forest-associated fungi. The two secondary forests showed variable patterns of richness, composition and the overall abundance of generalist fungi, suggesting that community recovery is stochastic. Fungal community response to land use change mirrors patterns observed in macroscopic organisms, which indicates that the increased prevalence of generalist taxa is a consistent response to disturbance across broad taxonomic groups.","[Mueller, Rebecca C.; Bohannan, Brendan J.

T-Hg levels were measured using a direct mercury analyzer. The overall mean T-Hg level in hair for humans in the Caqueta River sample (n = 200) was 17.29 +/- 0.61 mu g/g (1.2 to 47.0 mu g/g). Ninety-four percent of the individuals had hair T-Hg concentrations greater than the WHO threshold level (5 mu g/g), and 79 % displayed levels higher than 10 mu g/g. Average Hg concentrations in fish varied between 0.10-0.15 mu g/g and 0.10-1.60 mu g/g, for noncarnivorous and carnivorous species, respectively. Based on the maximum allowable fish consumption rate for adults, most carnivorous species should be avoided in the diet, as their target hazard quotient ranged from 2.96 up to 31.05, representing a risk for Hg-related health problems. In the light of existing evidence for elevated Hg levels in the indigenous population of the Colombian Amazon, carnivorous fish should be restricted as part of the diet, and breastfeeding should be reduced to protect children health.

While unauthorized cross-border interactions in tropical forest regions are quite common, the implications for forest policies have been explored very little. This paper uses territorialisation theory to explore the presence of illegal immigrants in tropical forest borderlands and links these theories to forest policies. In the northern Bolivian Amazon, borderland territorialisation efforts become quickly enmeshed in political struggles that extended beyond the border region. When this happened, forest policy and administration become entangled in struggles for control not only over the forests and borders, but by the efforts of political parties for national control. The importance of territorialisation concepts and related theoretical principles, therefore, demonstrates that a forest policy analysis approach in tropical forest borderlands that does not include these concepts may be too limited to analyse or explain efforts of government actors and local stakeholders in the forestry sectors. Understanding forestry policies and administration in remote, inaccessible and poorly controlled forest borderlands may require not only framing the discussion within the conventional theories that are typically used in forest policy analysis, but also applying territorialisation theory and other relevant theories.

Cells in the landscapes were modeled as vertices of dynamic graph automata that allow temporally variable causal connectivity between spatially nonadjacent cells. A trial was carried out to represent changes in an Amazonian and a tropical Andean landscape modeled as dynamic graph automata with input from a Landsat TM-derived Level 1 classification with the following classes: for the Amazon-forest, nonforest vegetation, water, and urban or bare (soil); for the Andes-forest, scrub (shrub or grassland), agriculture, and bare or exposed ground. Explicit automata transition rules were used to simulate temporal land-cover change. These rules were derived independently from fieldwork in each area, including vegetation plots or transects and informal interviews. Such a generalization of cellular automata was useful for modeling land-use-land-cover change (LULCC), although it potentially increases the computational complexity of an already data intensive process (involving 5-8 million cells, in 1000 stochastic simulations, with each simulation encompassing 15 annual time steps). The interannual predicted LULCC, while more nuanced in the Andean site, poses a serious threat to compositional and configurational stability in both the Andes and the Amazon, with implications for landscape heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation.","[Sarkar, Sahotra; Kelley, Christopher D.] Univ Texas Austin, Biodivers & Biocultural Conservat Lab, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Sarkar, Sahotra; Crews-Meyer, Kelley A.; Young, Kenneth R.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geog & Environm, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Sarkar, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Biodivers & Biocultural Conservat Lab, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",sarkar@mail.utexas.edu; kacm@uts.cc.utexas.edu; kryoung@austin.utexas.edu; iamchriskelley@gmail.com; amoffett@mail.utexas.edu,,,,,,,5,6,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2009.0,36.0,2,,,,300,318,,10.1068/b33146,,,,,,,,WOS:000265816500008,

The dominant species in fallows, however, were different from those in forest. Lands cropped using slash-and-burn maintained moderate numbers of species-both forest and non-forest. Trends in plant density (individuals per unit ground area) on cropped lands were mainly related to invasion of weedy species (increasing in time after slash-and-burn) and shifts in crop species (replacement of small-sized rice by larger-sized maize and cassava). Useful forest plants (e.g. for construction purposes, food and medicines) decreased with land conversion, although new species also appeared. The fewest species, tree species, and useful plants, and the greatest losses of the forest flora, were encountered in pastures.

Their omission can lead to serious underestimates, particularly for meat. Here we estimate emissions from the conversion of forest to pasture in the Legal Amazon Region (LAR) of Brazil and present a model to distribute the emissions from deforestation over products and time subsequent to the land use change. Expansion of cattle ranching for beef production is a major cause of deforestation in the LAR. The carbon footprint of beef produced on newly deforested land is estimated at more than 700 kg CO(2)-equivalents per kg carcass weight if direct land use emissions are annualized over 20 years. This is orders of magnitude larger than the figure for beef production on established pasture on non deforested land. While Brazilian beef exports have origmated mainly from areas outside the LAR, i.e. from regions not subject to recent deforestation, we argue that increased production for export has been the key driver of the pasture expansion and deforestation in the LAR during the past decade and this should be reflected in the carbon footprint attributed to beef exports. We conclude that carbon footprint standards must include the more extended effects of land use changes to avoid giving misleading information to policy makers, retailers, and consumers.","[Cederberg, Christel] SIK, Swedish Inst Food & Biotechnol, S-40229 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Persson, U.

Results indicate that MODIS data may be useful in Providing a first estimate of national forest cover change on an annual basis for Brazil.

This ratio was used to scale the MODIS change indicators to the PRUDES area estimates. A sliding threshold of percent PRODES forest and 2000 to 2005 deforestation classes per MODIS grid cell was used to match the scaled MODIS to the official PRODES change estimates, and then to differentiate MODIS change within various sub-areas of the PRODES analysis.

Results emphasize the importance of synoptic monitoring of all forest change dynamics, including the cover dynamics of intact humid forest, regrowth, plantations, and cerrado tree cover assemblages. Results also indicate that operational MODIS-only forest cover loss algorithms may be useful in providing near-real time areal estimates of annual change within the Amazon Basin.

In order to understand its impact on carbon cycle variability, we derive the 2011 - 2010 annual carbon flux change (delta F-up arrow) globally and specifically to Brazil using the NASA Carbon Monitoring System Flux (CMS-Flux) framework. Satellite observations of CO2, CO, and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) are ingested into a 4D-variational assimilation system driven by carbon cycle models to infer spatially resolved carbon fluxes including net ecosystem production, biomass burning, and gross primary productivity (GPP). The global 2011 - 2010 net carbon flux change was estimated to be delta F-up arrow = -1.60 PgC, while the Brazilian carbon flux change was -0.24 +/- 0.11 PgC. This estimate is broadly within the uncertainty of previous aircraft-based estimates restricted to the Amazon basin. The 2011-2010 biomass burning change in Brazil was -0.24 +/- 0.036 PgC, which implies a near-zero 2011-2010 change of the net ecosystem production (NEP): The near-zero NEP change is the result of quantitatively comparable increases GPP (0.31 +/- 0.20 PgC) and respiration in 2011. Comparisons between Brazilian and global component carbon flux changes reveal complex interactions between the processes controlling annual land-atmosphere CO2 exchanges. These results show the potential of multiple satellite observations to help quantify and spatially resolve the response of productivity and respiration fluxes to climate variability.","[Bowman, K.

Insights from combining agent-based simulations with robust order-m eco-efficiency estimation,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Agricultural production plays an essential role in food security and economic development, but given its direct links within the environment, it is also an important driver of environmental degradation. It has become essential to not only produce more crops but doing it while maintaining or reducing the respective environmental impacts. A promising method for evaluating production efficiency is the nonparametric eco-efficiency analysis, which compares the economic value added against a composite environmental pressure indicator. This article proposes a novel method of evaluating the eco-efficiency scores, which does not depend on field survey data, but rather on multi-agent simulations. We present the first estimates of eco-efficiency for crop farms in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes in Brazil, identify regions and farm profiles that could be the focus of targeted interventions, and evaluate whether eco-efficiency scores could be improved using an alternative scenario. We combine a biophysical model with bioeconomic agentbased simulations to mimic land-use decisions of real-world farms. We then estimate the efficiency scores with an enhanced order-m estimator that conditions the efficiency estimates on explanatory variables, thus producing robust efficiency measures. Our simulations reveal that there are indeed differences in eco-efficiency estimates between macro-regions in the federal state of Mato Grosso. According to our simulations, the Southeast exhibited the greatest occurrences of inefficiencies, followed by the West macro-region. In our life-cycle inventory, sunflower cultivation had the lowest levels of environmental pressures. However, when evaluating it in a prospective scenario of infrastructure development, we could not observe a positive impact on efficiency. By using efficient computational methods, we replicate our simulations many times to create robust estimates that are more representative than a single field survey. In addition, our novel method combines simulated farm data with eco-efficiency analyses, allowing ex-ante impact evaluations where policy interventions can be tested before their implementation.","[Carauta, Marcelo; Berger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Wollgrasweg 43, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Grovermann, Christian; Heidenreich, Anja] Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, Dapt Socioecon Sci, Ackerstr 113, CH-5070 Frick, Switzerland",,"Carauta, M (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Wollgrasweg 43, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",carauta@uni-hohenheim.de; christian.grovermann@fibl.org; anja.heidenreich@fibl.org; i490d@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1,2022.0,819.0,,,,,,,153072,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153072,,,,,,,,WOS:000766811700001,

Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A. Juss.) Mull. Arg., whose center of diversity is the Amazon basin, is the major source of commercial rubber in the world, In the 1970s, the need for new Hevea germplasm arose from the realization that there was a gradual erosion of the genetic variability of the rubber clones in many natural rubber plantations. This erosion occurred because most of the clones in cultivation were derived from the few surviving seeds collected in 1876 by Henry Wickham. Therefore, to broaden the genetic base of the major producers of natural rubber, it became necessary to undertake an expedition to the Amazon basin to obtain materials for the 'gene pool' in these populations. This expedition, called Germplasm 81,  was organized in four stages. Initially, there was a 1976 seminar organized by the International Rubber Research and Development Board (IRRDB); then, in 1977, a Hevea workshop took place, also organized by the IRRDB. A preliminary mission by IRRDB officials to several countries in South America and the Caribbean followed in 1978. Finally, the Germplasm exercise by scientists from IRRDB countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Thailand), China, and Brazil took place from January to April of 1981. A 'dummy run' to test the viability of seeds from Manaus, Brazil, was undertaken in 1979. The Germplasm collection covered three Brazilian states: Acre, Mato Grosso, and Rondonia. Collection teams traveled into the remotest parts of the Amazon rain forests looking for high-yielding and disease-resistant trees from which to collect seeds, budwood, and seedlings growing around the trees. Three teams collected a total of 64;256 seeds, 1413 meters of budwood, and 1160 seedlings. Following agreements with the Brazilian government, collected seeds were divided on a 50-50 basis between IRRDB and Brazil. Materials for Brazil were retained in Manaus, while those for the IRRDB were initially sent to Britain for phytosanitary treatment and then to Guadeloupe for further quarantine in 1982, before being sent to Asian and African reception centers. Scientists who participated in the exercise had to undergo quarantine in a temperate country for at least one week before returning to their research institutions. This quarantine was an attempt to avoid the spread of the deadly South American leaf blight (SALB) disease. This disease has prevented Brazil from becoming a major world producer of natural rubber, despite attempts made by Goodyear and Firestone Rubber Companies, as well as Henry Ford in the early 1900s.","Florida A&M Univ, Forestry & Nat Resource Conservat, Coll Engn Sci Technol & Agr, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA",,"Onokpise, OU (corresponding author), Florida A&M Univ, Forestry & Nat Resource Conservat, Coll Engn Sci Technol & Agr, Room 303,S Perry Paige Bldg, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA.",o.onokpise@worldnet.att.net,,,,,,,17,20,,,,,,,,,,,WIN,2004.0,58.0,4,,,,544,555,,10.1663/0013-0001(2004)058[0544:NRHBWE]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,WOS:000227297600006,

Tropical deforestation is known to cause alterations in microbial communities at taxonomic and phylogenetic levels, but it is unclear whether microbial functional groups are altered. We asked whether free-living nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) respond to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, using analysis of the marker gene nifH. Clone libraries were generated from soil samples collected from a primary forest, a 5-year-old pasture originally converted from primary forest, and a secondary forest established after pasture abandonment. Although diazotroph richness did not significantly change among the three plots, diazotroph community composition was altered with forest-to-pasture conversion, and phylogenetic similarity was higher among pasture communities than among those in forests. There was also 10-fold increase in nifH gene abundance following conversion from primary forest to pasture. Three environmental factors were associated with the observed changes: soil acidity, total N concentration, and C/N ratio. Our results suggest a partial restoration to initial levels of abundance and community structure of diazotrophs following pasture abandonment, with primary and secondary forests sharing similar communities. We postulate that the response of diazotrophs to land use change is a direct consequence of changes in plant communities, particularly the higher N demand of pasture plant communities for supporting aboveground plant growth.","[Mirza, Babur S.; Potisap, Chotima; Rodrigues, Jorge L.

He traveled up the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers, penetrating into what are now the states of Tocantins and Goias. Buscalioni's was a relatively early expedition for Amazonia: only six substantial collections (> 1,000 numbers) are known to have been made prior to 1900 in all of Brazilian Amazonia. Moreover, the upper Rio Tocantins and the Rio Araguaia remain poorly known botanically, so his collection undoubtedly contains much valuable information about the original flora of that region. This information unfortunately has been unavailable, however, because most of the collection languished in bundles at the RO herbarium for the best part of a hundred years, from the turn of the century until 1984, when the junior author discovered their existence during a re-organization of the RO herbarium, and 1995, when a visit by the senior author coincided with the recovery of revealing historical archives. The label information and preliminary taxonomy have now been data-based and are available over the Internet. In addition to his collections, Buscalioni's Amazonian legacy includes participation in debates about the origins of myrmecophily and the Amazonian savannas, the botanical identity of the commercial latex called caucho, and (indirectly) the founding of the INPA research institute in Manaus, Brazil.

Environmental licensing for rural properties is being implemented in several states in the Brazilian Amazon with the goal of restoring forests in agricultural landscapes and mediating the impacts of these stressors. This study presents an agent-based model of ranching and land exchange, informs it with empirical results from social research in the Ji-Parana River Basin, Rondonia, Brazil, and investigates the social, economic, and environmental outcomes that can be expected as a result of environmental licensing in the context of climate change. Model results informed by these data suggest that although an environmental licensing scheme with monitoring and enforcement may increase the level of forested land in ranching landscapes, it may do so at the expense of the small producer. To the extent that effective monitoring and enforcement exist, a focus on larger holdings will help to mediate this negative social impact.

At the interface between societies and their environment, ecosystem services (ES) is an integrated working framework through which natural and anthropogenic dimensions can be addressed. Here, we aimed to understand to what extent farmers impact ES availability. Based on case studies in three locations in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, we performed statistical analyses at 135 sampling points and 110 farms to link socioeconomic and ES data, both derived from field work. The socioeconomic data characterized agricultural production, sociological characteristics, and quality of life. ES data were obtained from statistical analyses that yielded a multiple ES indicator for each sampling point and farm. Our results produced three main findings: first, the establishment of ES associations is due more to agricultural production characteristics than to sociological and quality-of-life factors. Second, the impact of agricultural production on ES availability depends on the level of total incomes. An increase in incomes causes a decrease in the forest cover that provides many ES and an increase in other areas that provide fewer ES. Finally, our analyses show a very strong site effect that probably expresses the heterogeneity of the biophysical contexts, but also the importance for ES availability of the historical depth of deforestation and/or the role of specific public policies. Finding ways of producing an alternative impact on ES availability and establishing specific ES associations will therefore depend more on changes in the global political context than in individual practices.","[Solen, Le Clec'h] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agr Econ & Policy AECP Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Solen, Le Clec'h; Simon, Dufour; Johan, Oszwald] Univ Europeenne Bretagne Rennes 2, UMR CNRS 6554, Lab LETG Rennes COSTEL, Rennes, France; [Nicolas, Jegou] Univ Europeenne Bretagne Rennes 2, UMR CNRS 6625, Lab IRMAR, Rennes, France; [Xavier, Arnauld de Sartre] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, UMR CNRS 5319, Lab SET, Paris, France; [Thibaud, Decaens] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut,IRD, UMR CNRS 5175,EPHE,SupAgro Montpellier,INRA, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Michel, Grimaldi] IRD, UMR 242, iEES Paris, Ctr IRD,France Nord, Paris, France",,"Solen, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agr Econ & Policy AECP Grp, Zurich, Switzerland.; Solen, L (corresponding author), Univ Europeenne Bretagne Rennes 2, UMR CNRS 6554, Lab LETG Rennes COSTEL, Rennes, France.",solen.le@ethz.ch,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2018.0,61.0,5,,,,772,785,,10.1007/s00267-018-1004-y,,,,,,,,WOS:000428990600005,

These diurnal lizards are active primarily during mid- to late morning on fallen logs or low on tree trunks. They are heliothermic averaging 32.9 +/- 0.98 C in body temperatures. Prey include orthopterans, spiders, eruciform larvae, termites, and other invertebrates. Prey differences between the two sites most likely reflect differences in prey availability associated with tropical seasonality in rainfall. Mabuya bistriata reach sexual maturity by the end of the first year of life, and females produce their first brood at an age of one yr. Females have larger body size than males, and males have larger head size than females. Females ovulate ova 1 mm in diameter and 0.47 mg dry mass. A chorioallantoic placenta forms through apposition of the chorioallantois to the uterine mucosa. During gestation, dry and wet mass increase by over 47,400% and 74,700%, respectively, with virtually all nutrients for development supplied by the female. Gestation lasts 9-12 months. Brood size varies from 2-9, and females with near-term embryos are heavier and wider than nongravid females suggesting a potential cost to reproduction related to the effect of clutch mass and volume on locomotor abilities.","UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA; TRINITY COLL, DEPT BIOL, HARTFORD, CT 06106 USA",,"VITT, LJ (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA, OKLAHOMA MUSEUM NAT HIST, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.",,,,,,,,98,101,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 13,1991.0,,4,,,,916,927,,10.2307/1446087,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GW22100004,

Influence on seasonal soil moisture and evapotranspiration,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"We investigate the potential influence of groundwater on seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) in the Amazon using a coupled groundwater-surface water model (LEAF-Hydro-Flood) forced with ERA-Interim reanalysis, at 2 km grid and 4 min steps over 11 yrs (2000-2010), and validated with available soil moisture and ET observations. We find that first, the simulated water table is <2 m deep over a significant portion of the Amazon (20-40%). Second, shallow groundwater can reduce wet season soil drainage, leading to larger soil water stores before the dry season arrives. Third, capillary rises from the water table can reach the root zone and maintain high dry season ET near the valleys. Fourth, groundwater's delayed response to rainfall can buffer surface stress in the dry season, when groundwater is the shallowest. Fifth, this temporal delay can be seen as spatial patterns; continued drainage and convergence maintain moist valleys forming a structured mosaic of wet-dry patches in the dry season. Results from two parallel runs, with and without groundwater, suggest that overall groundwater made a large difference in modeled soil moisture where the water table is shallow, but it only made a difference in modeled ET where the seasonality is strong; over southeastern Amazonia, July-August ET differs by similar to 1 mm/day. We note that our results are based on model simulations, which only suggest the potential importance of the groundwater system to the Amazon water cycle. The ultimate knowledge must come from carefully designed field observations linking vegetation, soil and groundwater with water balance studies and tracer tests, across a range of physical-biological settings.","[Fan, Ying] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA; [Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Phys 15782, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Galicia, Spain",,"Fan, Y (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA.",yingfan@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,75,76,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 14,2012.0,117.0,,,,,,,D15114,10.1029/2012JD017540,,,,,,,,WOS:000307752900004,

In the face of expanding ranches and plantations, this cash crop solution accepts the destruction of forest ecosystems and livelihoods as inevitable, funneling smallholders into market agroforestry in agro-industrial landscapes.

The case of southwestern Beni, Bolivian Amazon, 1986-2009",APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"As land use change continues to increase throughout the Amazon basin, there is a pressing need to accurately map, quantify and assess the effects of different factors on forest cover change (FCC). Land tenure may sometimes have important effects on forest cover, yet such effects remain poorly understood in Amazonia, particularly outside Brazil. In this paper we assess whether significant differences in trends of FCC can be partially explained by different land tenure arrangements, using a case study in southwestern Beni (Bolivian Amazon). We examine spatio-temporal dynamics of FCC across four land tenure systems (indigenous titled territory, protected area, logging concession, and private land) by classifying forests using a time-series of Landsat satellite imagery consisting of four dates (1986, 1996, 2001, 2009). Specifically, we unravel (1) trends in early growth and old-growth forest extent, including changes in total cover area, annual change rates, and spatial change dynamics, and (2) trends in old-growth forest fragmentation. To better understand the association between land tenure and FCC, we qualitatively assess the potential role that other underlying and proximate drivers may have had in FCC over the study period. We found that private lands underwent, by far, the largest FCC, that indigenous territories and the protected area had little FCC, and that logging concessions were responsible for the lowest FCC. Our findings suggest that land tenure played a key role in FCC except in private areas, where many other drivers had operated. Our study sheds light into the potential role of land tenure in FCC and has important implications for public policies aimed at socioeconomic development and environmental conservation in the Amazon. We give some policy recommendations drawn from a biocultural conservation perspective that could contribute to implement more inclusive conservation policies in the region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To detect the drought effects on different vegetation types, many methodologies have been developed, mostly relying on the use of vegetation indices. This communication reports the first attempt to assess the capability of MODIS NDVI, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from 2000 to 2006 time-series to detect the 2005 drought in Amazonia. To reach this objective, monthly composites of the MOD13A2 product were generated from period. Then, monthly anomalies were calculated, considering anomalous values when lower than -1 standard, deviation (sd) or higher than 1 sd. Rainfall data provided by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was also acquired for the same time-series with the objective of supporting the understanding of vegetation response with the precipitation. Water deficit data calculated based on the TRMM data were also used to guide the sampling scheme. A land cover map for South America updated with natural land cover changes detected by the Near Real Time Deforestation Detection Project (DETER) was used as a mask to avoid false anomalies in the Brazilian Amazon. In general, NDWI and EVI showed to be sensitive and consistent for the temporal series used. NDVI presented a high variability and though a difficult interpretation. Critical months in the NDWI and EVI series coincided with the months with higher water stress calculated based on the TRMM data. EVI also showed to detect changes in the canopy structure. These preliminary results suggest that this is a strong methodology to be used in the spatial analysis of the extent of the drought effects in the vegetation.

However, empirical studies assessing to what extent TEK is associated with forest conservation compared with other variables are rare. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the spatial overlap of TEK and forest conservation has not been evaluated at fine scales. In this paper, we address both issues through a case study with Tsimane' Amerindians in the Bolivian Amazon. We sampled 624 households across 59 villages to estimate TEK and used remote sensing data to assess forest conservation. We ran statistical and spatial analyses to evaluate whether TEK was associated and spatially overlapped with forest conservation at the village level. We find that Tsimane' TEK is significantly and positively associated with forest conservation although acculturation variables bear stronger and negative associations with forest conservation. We also find a very significant spatial overlap between levels of Tsimane' TEK and forest conservation. We discuss the potential reasons underpinning our results, which provide insights that may be useful for informing policies in the realms of development, conservation, and climate. We posit that the protection of indigenous cultural systems is vital and urgent to create more effective policies in such realms.","[Paneque-Galvez, Jaime; Perez-Llorente, Irene; Mas, Jean-Francois] UNAM, CIGA, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Luz, Ana Catarina; Orta-Martinez, Marti] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Edificio C2, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gueze, Maximilien; Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Edifici Z, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Macia, Manuel J.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Unidad Bot, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Orta-Martinez, Marti] Univ Cent Catalunya Univ Vic, Fac Ciencies & Tecnol, Carrer Sagrada Familia 7, Barcelona 08500, Spain; [Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICREA, Edifici Z, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",,"Paneque-Galvez, J (corresponding author), UNAM, CIGA, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico.",jpanequegalvez@ciga.unam.mx; ireneperezllorente@gmail.com; acluz@fc.ul.pt; maximilien.gueze@gmail.com; jfmas@ciga.unam.mx; manuel.macia@uam.es; martiorta@gmail.com; victoria.reyes@uab.cat,,,,,,,17,17,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2018.0,47,8,,,,908,923,,10.1007/s13280-018-1040-0,,,,,,,,WOS:000449928600007,

Relative comparisons of VI-regime convective properties reveal 1) slightly larger (20% - 25%) PR pixel-mean rainfall during periods of northerly VI due to increased stratiform precipitation, 2) a factor of 2 or more increase in lightning flash density and the lightning diurnal cycle amplitude during periods of southerly VI, 3) a factor of 1.5 - 2 increase in the conditional probability of any PR radar reflectivity pixel exceeding 30 dBZ above the - 10 degrees C level during periods of southerly VI, and 4) an associated factor of 2 or more increase in southerly VI pixel-mean ice water path, with the ice water path being highly correlated to trends in lightning activity. During periods of southerly VI, convection occurs in an environment of increased thermodynamic instability, weak southeasterly low-level, and deep upper-tropospheric easterly wind shear. During periods of northerly VI, low-level westerly shear opposes stronger deep tropospheric easterly shear in a relatively moist environment of weaker thermodynamic instability, consistent with the occurrence of more widespread stratiform precipitation. The composite results of this study point to 1) regime differences in convective forcing that alter the prevalence of ice processes and, by inference, the vertical profile of latent heating and 2) the utility of lightning observations in delineating convective regime changes.","Univ Alabama, ESSC, NSSTC, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; NASA, George C Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Huntsville, AL 35812 USA",,"Petersen, WA (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, ESSC, NSSTC, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA.",walt.petersen@msfc.nasa.gov,,,,,,,20,23,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2006.0,19,13,,,,3180,3196,,10.1175/JCLI3788.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000239026300009,

Humid tropical forests are vulnerable to projected climate change and possible synergistic interactions with deforestation and fire, which may initiate a positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO2. Here, we present results from a multifactorial impact analysis that combined an ensemble of climate change models with feedbacks from deforestation and accidental fires to quantify changes in Amazon Basin carbon cycling. Using the LPJmL Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, we modelled spatio-temporal changes in net biome production (NBP); the difference between carbon fluxes from fire, deforestation, soil respiration and net primary production. By 2050, deforestation and fire (with no CO2 increase or climate change) resulted in carbon losses of 7.4-20.3 Pg C with the range of uncertainty depending on socio-economic storyline. During the same time period, interactions between climate and land use either compensated for carbon losses due to wetter climate and CO2 fertilization or exacerbated carbon losses from drought-induced forest mortality (-20.1 to +4.3 Pg C). By the end of the 21st century, depending on climate projection and the rate of deforestation (including its interaction with fire), carbon stocks either increased (+12.6 Pg C) or decreased (-40.6 Pg C). The synergistic effect of deforestation and fire with climate change contributed up to 26-36 Pg C of the overall decrease in carbon stocks. Agreement between climate projections (n=9), not accounting for deforestation and fire, in 2050 and 2098 was relatively low for the directional change in basin-wide NBP (19-37%) and aboveground live biomass (13-24%). The largest uncertainty resulted from climate projections, followed by implementation of ecosystem dynamics and deforestation. Our analysis partitions the drivers of tropical ecosystem change and is relevant for guiding mitigation and adaptation policy related to global change.","[Poulter, Benjamin] Swiss Fed Res Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WS, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Poulter, Benjamin; Heyder, Ursula; Gumpenberger, Marlies; Heinke, Jens; Langerwisch, Fanny; Rammig, Anja; Thonicke, Kirsten; Cramer, Wolfgang] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Aragao, Luiz] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Aragao, Luiz] Univ Exeter, Sch Geog, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",,"Poulter, B (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WS, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",Benjamin.Poulter@wsl.ch,,,,,,,39,40,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2010.0,16,7,,,,2062,2075,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02064.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000278308100014,

The results show a quite homogenous freshwater pool over the country. However, the low slope of the coast, a result of the wide mud banks deposited by the Amazonian plume, have turned the mouths of the smaller rivers to the northwest, creating large salty areas where mangroves grow several kilometers inland. Despite the large amount of Amazonian water, the Guianan coast exhibits high salinity. In fact, the freshwater itself remains far from the shore, following the north Brazilian current, while only the mud plume arrives at the coast, creating this paradox. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

Mercury exposure of Amazonian fish eaters was considerably higher than Quebec (Median blood total Hg: 28 and I mug/l, respectively), but fish from the St, Lawrence contain multiple contaminants, For the Tapajos River. increasing hair Hg was associated with reduced motor and visual functions. Comparison of neurobehavioral performance of Quebec fish-eaters and non fish-caters showed a consistent pattern of information processing slowing among the former, these deficits were not related to blood methyl Hg levels. Early changes associated with exposure can be used to trigger intervention. Since fish provide important essential nutrients, mitigation must balance the beneficial and harmful effects.

Unlike many previous regression-based studies, the methodology implemented analyzes behavior at the level of the individual property, using both survey data and information derived from the classification of remotely sensed imagery. The regressions correct for endogenous relationships between key variables and spatial autocorrelation, as necessary. Variables used in the analysis are specified, in part, by a theoretical development integrating the Chayanovian concept of the peasant household with spatial considerations stemming from von Thunen. Results from the empirical model indicate that demographic characteristics of households, as well as market factors, affect deforestation in the Amazon basin associated with colonists. Therefore, statistical results from studies that do not include household-scale information may be subject to error. From a policy perspective, the results suggest that environmental policies in the Amazon based on market incentives to small farmers may not be as effective as hoped, given the importance of household factors in catalyzing the demand for land. The article concludes by noting that household decisions regarding land use and deforestation are not independent of broader social circumstances, and that a full understanding of Amazonian deforestation will require insight into why poor families find it necessary to settle the frontier in the first place.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Hobart & William Smith Coll, Environm Studies Program, Geneva, NY 14456 USA; Inst Homem & Meio Ambiente Amazonia, Geneva, NY 14456 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Sociol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Caldas, M (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, 116 Geog Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",caldasma@msu.edu; rwalker@msu.edu; aldric30@msu.edu; simmo108@msu.edu; arima@hws.edu; sperz@soc.ufl.edu,,,,,,,106,110,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2007.0,97,1,,,,86,110,,10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00525.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000244775700006,

This investment will further consolidate Brazil's position as the leading exporter of wood-pulp coming from vast, corporate-controlled industrial plantations. These inland forestry investments are a feature of the second wave of large pulp projects, extending inland from the best lands in the coastal belt via accessible rivers and railroad networks. This globally significant inland expansion has been poorly studied, if at all. No publications exist on this Suzano pulp project. Empirically, this article provides a baseline study on the political economic dynamics. The case is highly relevant for conflict theory. Generally, industrial tree plantation expansion has boosted grievances, but the resistance and conflicts have varied depending on the social actors' agency. In comparison to the high-intensity conflicts between the rural social movements such as the Brazilian landless Movement (MST) and the pulp companies in most other new investments, there has been a rare absence of conflict in this case, as no movement has seized on local grievances. Conflicts cannot be studied in-depth by focusing only on conflict cases. Absence-cases open up an opportunity to revisit the question why conflicts arise. An analysis of this case allows an empirically rooted theoretical discussion on conflict causalities, which can answer several vexing questions in the study of conflicts. A new and generally applicable typology of different types of grievances is offered, and the grievances' causal relation to conflicts is examined. The importance of political dynamics and inter-personal relations in investment conflicts is emphasized. The way culture influences conflict dynamics is pondered upon by ethnography of the Brazilian conflict culture, where personal relations are more relevant in explaining conflict escalation than in the political systems with a stronger (impersonal) rule of law. The role of third parties such as other industries in the investment area is discussed. A qualitative comparative analysis of the major pulp project conflicts and their causes in Latin America is offered. Mobilization and thus conflict causality is explainable only when taking into account the types of grievances and the local, inter-personal, and organizational (state-business-movement) relations by which these are remediated and negotiated.

Most of this mining activity is in the Amazon region, where miners have been extracting gold for more than 40 years. In the Tapajos River Basin, assessments indicate that around 99% of miners operate without the environmental and mining permits required by law. This is a result of a combination of unrealistic or lack of proper policies and regulations, lack of political will, lack of infra-structure to enforce the existing regulations and lack of incentives to miners to comply with legal requirements. In this article, we analyze a group of 20 laws, decrees and resolutions in Brazil, focusing on how idiosyncrasies in these regulations reveal gaps between policy and reality in ASGM areas. Artisanal miners operate in vast and remote areas and the government lacks the resources (personnel, vehicles, information and materials) to enforce the laws. Our analysis emphasizes the need for creating new government commitments and identifying priority areas where government agents can focus their efforts. There is no single solution for the environmental, health, technical and socio-economic problems associated with ASGM. However, a realistic approach should consider improving the level of education of miners, creating government programs to provide technical assistance in the field, simplifying administrative procedures and ensuring adequate measures for enforcement.

Consumption has increased due to the antioxidant contents. Distribution of this wild Amazonic palm is widespread and it is possible to find more than one species. While in Brazilian forests, E. oleraceae is the most abundant; in the eastern Amazon, the principal species is E. precatoria. During recent decades, many institutes, universities and research centers have studied many topics related to the palm. Despite these advances, harvest indices, postharvest handling, as well as processing lack the necessary knowledge for the well-timed harvest of bunches and fruit handling, in order to take advantage of this biological resource. Skin color and pigment contents are good harvest indices. Fresh fruits are not usually consumed but pulp, beverages and dehydrated powders constitute commercial products. To obtain good products from the fruit, postharvest handling includes conditioning operations such as selection and classification, which assure the delay of fruit decay and fermentation. Some processing protocols have been developed in order to obtain pulp and dry powder from asai fruit, which preserve high antioxidant activities due to polyphenolic compounds. Uses of fruit pulp and dehydrated powders have diverse applications and all of them preserve a functional condition, such as in energy bars, instant beverages, chocolate fillers and gummy confectionery. Asai fruits exhibit interesting options for the food industry with high potential for inclusion in many derivatives that satisfy industrial requirements, which could be reinforced with advances in technology and innovative processing to enhance preservation of the functional bioactive compounds.","[Daz, R.

In this study, both the effects of the NBC and tidal current on ISW generation are considered over irregular seafloor. Near-critical conditions (internal Froude number close to 1) created by the joint effects of the NBC and the tides result in ISW generation, while the dominant subcritical conditions result in the upstream propagation of these ISWs. Both the NBC and tidal currents are needed to continuously generate ISWs. This study demonstrates that small-scale topographic features can result in the generation of large numbers of ISWs, which are expected to significantly contribute to ocean mixing and, potentially, sediment resuspension.

Indeed, the divergent positions adopted by different groups of relatives need to be examined in relation to the dynamics of socio-economic differentiation linked to family histories. The article shows that the conflict related back to power struggles between dominant groups of relatives and that the questions about the limits of the group reflected preoccupations concerning who held legitimate authority to make decisions about the future of the village. By analysing some of the assumptions of the current debate about multiculturalism and ethnicity in Amazonia, this article contributes to the wider discussion about these issues in Brazil and, more broadly, in Latin America.","[Boyer, Veronique] Mondes Americains, Paris, France; [Boyer, Veronique] CERMA, Poza Rica, Veracruz, Mexico; [Boyer, Veronique] French Natl Ctr Sci Res, Paris, France",,"Boyer, V (corresponding author), Mondes Americains, Paris, France.",veronique.boyer@ehess.fr,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2014.0,46,3,,,,527,555,,10.1017/S0022216X14000728,,,,,,,,WOS:000340208700004,

Methods: We used an ecosystem approach, integrating Hg measurements with socio-cultural and politico-economic elements, to provide an integral analysis and comprehensive solutions. Results: Our interdisciplinary research in the Ecuadorian Andean Amazon has shown that comestible fish and riparian communities which rely on fish as a major protein source have mercury levels that could potentially cause subtle but deleterious population health alterations. A parallel study identified deforestation and soil erosion as a significant source of mercury to the aquatic ecosystem. Interpretation: The analysis of these results in conjunction with the prevailing socio-cultural and politico-economic context allowed us to identify economic trends, and especially petroleum exploitation, as pivotal in the deforestation/mercury-exposure dynamic. In collaboration with public health authorities, we shared our results with local health stakeholders, including public health care staff, federal government agencies, researchers and local communities, in such a way as to promote sustainable land use practices and the nutritional benefits of fish eating while reducing toxic exposures.","CINBIOSE, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",,"Webb, J (corresponding author), CINBIOSE, Case Postale 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",webb.jennifer@uqam.ca,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,JAN-FEB,2005.0,96,1,,,,44,46,,10.1007/BF03404015,,,,,,,,WOS:000226532700011,

Secondary forests growing on cleared lands and tree plantations are becoming increasingly widespread land-uses in the tropics. Previous studies are divided on the conservation importance of these habitats for tropical forest butterflies. 2. We use a robust sampling design, accounting for both seasonality and vertical stratification, to examine fruit-feeding butterflies (Nymphalidae) in patches of secondary forest and Eucalyptus plantation 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than those previously sampled. 3. We recorded 10 587 butterflies and 128 species in 3200 trap-days. Species richness was highest in primary forest and lowest in plantations, while butterfly abundance showed the opposite response. All habitats were distinct in terms of community structure. 4. There was a significant interaction between habitat and season based on richness and abundance metrics, although not based on community structure. Secondary forest exhibited higher observed richness than primary forest in the peak of the dry-season, but not at other times of the year. This observation could explain the lack of consensus in previous studies, as those reporting higher richness in secondary forest only sampled during the dry-season. 5. In general, habitat quality appeared to be more important than the surrounding landscape in determining butterfly community structure. However, the community structure of the strong-flying Charaxinae was related to the amount of primary forest in surrounding landscape. There was very poor congruence between the response patterns of richness and abundance among different butterfly subfamilies. 6. Linear regressions between resource availability and butterfly abundance showed a strong influence of leaf phenology in both primary and secondary forest, but no influence of fruit phenology. 7. Synthesis and applications: A lack of seasonal replication and small sampling sizes may have led previous studies to over-emphasize the conservation importance of secondary forest and plantations for butterflies. We show that these habitats are significantly poorer than primary forest in terms of number of species, and hold distinct butterfly communities. Although quantifying the number of species restricted to primary forest remains difficult, these results cast doubt on the presumption that secondary habitats will provide refuge for many of the species being lost through deforestation. We therefore strongly urge measures that prioritize the conservation of remaining primary forests where they still exist.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",,"Barlow, J (corresponding author), Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Av Magalhaes Barata 376, BR-66040170 Belem, Para, Brazil.",J.Barlow@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,115,131,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2007.0,44,5,,,,1001,1012,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01347.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000249425100011,

In this article, we analyze the spatial distribution of multiple-ES indicators at three locations on the pioneer fronts of the Brazilian Amazon. We identify trade-offs and synergies between six ES indicators for soil, vegetation and biodiversity characterization. We also propose spatial representations of multiple-ES indicators (vegetation carbon stocks, rates of water infiltration into soil, soil chemical quality, soil carbon stocks, biodiversity and richness in Sphingidae). Finally, we discuss three different methods to map them depending on the goals of the maps, arguing that maps lean on objective-oriented approaches. The study is based on remote sensing and sampling data from 135 sampling points. We created multiple-ES indicators maps based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a score of ES richness, and discrimination of land cover units. PCA is an appropriate tool for showing high correlations between indicators, nevertheless has notable limitations for visual communication. The scoring method may help mapping ES hotspots, however it fails to consider relationships among them. The land-cover-based method has the advantage of being simple and easy to interpret, still it may not consider important indicators not related to land-cover changes. We discuss the interests and limitations of these different ways to map multiple-ES indicators, regarding the final goals of the maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Case studies are presented of two of the strongest events of the 1994 winter season: 26 June and 10 July 1994. In both events, daily minimum temperatures in southeastern Brazil dropped to near or below 0 degrees C, while at the same time minimum temperatures in southern Amazonia (Ji-Parana site) were almost 8 degrees C below average. Air temperature and humidity also fell in central and western Amazonia (Manaus and Maraba sites, respectively), although the fact that these reductions were less substantial than those farther to the south indicates that the cold air is greatly modified as it moves across Amazonia. In Ji-Parana the largest drops in minimum temperature coincided with strong winds from the south, implying that cold advection was the main mechanism for the falling temperatures. In contrast, there was no increase in wind speed at Manaus and Maraba during the days with reduced temperatures. At these sites, cooling was due to a reduction of the maximum temperature caused, at least partially, by increased cloudiness rather than by a lowering of minimum temperatures as at Ji-Parana. With regard to the depth of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), it is observed that during the passage of the cold air in southern Amazonia, the ABL was cooler and shallower than during the pre-and postfriagem days. The friagens presented are of 5- to 6-day duration, including the passage of the cold front, but the period with cold temperatures lasts between 2 and 3 days.","INST HYDROL,WALLINGFORD OX10 8BB,OXON,ENGLAND",,"Marengo, JA (corresponding author), INPE,CPTEC,CTR WEATHER FORECASTING & CLIMATE RES,NATL INST SPACE RES,BR-12630000 CACHOEIRA PAU,SAO PAULO,BRAZIL.",,,,,,,,36,42,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,1997.0,36,11,,,,1553,1566,,10.1175/1520-0450(1997)036<1553:CIOFIF>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YE05900009,

New versions of two advanced and widely used land surface schemes, the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) and the Simple Biosphere Model (SIB), reflect this change in understanding, although these two models make different assumptions regarding the response of stomata to atmospheric humidity deficit. The goal of this study was to evaluate the new, second version of BATS, here called BATS2, using: Amazon field data from the Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observational Study (ABRACOS) project, with an emphasis on comparison with the original version of BATS and the new, second version of SIE (SiB2). Evaluation of SiB2 using a 3-yr time series of ABRACOS data revealed that there is an unrealistic simulation of the yearly cycle in soil moisture status, with a resulting poor simulation of evaporation. Improved long-term simulation by SiB2 requires specification of a deeper rooting depth, and this requirement is general for all three models. In general, the original version of BATS with a revised root distribution and rooting depth gave good agreement with observations of the surface energy balance but occasionally showed excessive sensitivity to large atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. Evaluation of BATS2 revealed that changes are required in the parameters that determine stomatal behavior in the model for realistic simulation of transpiration, time-averaged respiration, and net carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake. When initiated with default values for carbon stores, BATS2 takes several hundred years to reach an equilibrium carbon balance. Aspects of the model's representation of instantaneous carbon allocation and respiration processes indicate that BATS2 cannot be expected to provide a realistic simulation of hourly variations in CO2 exchanges. In general, all three models have weaknesses when describing the field data with default values of model parameters. If a few model parameters are modified in a plausible way, however, all three models can be made to give a good time-averaged simulation of measured exchanges. There is little evidence of sensitivity to the different forms assumed for the stomatal response to atmospheric humidity deficit, although this study suggests that assuming that leaf stress is related linearly to relative humidity is marginally preferred.","Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Shuttleworth, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Harshbarger Bldg 11, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",shuttle@hwr.arizona.edu,,,,,,,18,23,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2000.0,1,2,,,,135,153,,10.1175/1525-7541(2000)001<0135:CEOBBA>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,WOS:000089483100003,

Despite major recent anthropogenic disruptions to the Amazon catchment area, data for trace metals such as copper (Cu) in the Amazon River estuary and associated mixing plume are still rare. Furthermore, there is currently no existing data in this region for Cu-binding ligands, which govern the amount of bioavailable Cu. To understand trace metal mixing and transport processes, the GEOTRACES process study GApr11 (cruise M147 with RV Meteor) was conducted in 2018 in the Amazon and Para River estuaries and mixing plume in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean during high river discharge. Size-fractionated surface samples were collected along the full salinity gradient for concentrations of Cu, apparent Cu-binding organic ligands (L-Cu) and corresponding conditional stability constants (K'(CuL,) (cond)(Cu2+)), electroactive humic substances (eHS), solid phase extractable organic Cu (SPE-Cu), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll a (Chl a) and macronutrients. Dissolved (<0.2 mu m) and soluble (<0.015 mu m) Cu correlated negatively with salinity and largely followed values expected from conservative mixing. Cu was primarily in the soluble fraction, with the exception of a minor fraction of large colloidal Cu at low salinity (S = 10). Organic ligands (log K' (cond)(CuL, Cu2+) = 12.6-15.6) were present in excess of Cu and likely played a role in solubilizing Cu and preventing Cu being affected by colloidal flocculation. Cu-associated DOM (measured as LCu, eHS and SPE-Cu) correlated negatively with salinity and appeared to be primarily governed by river input and mixing with seawater. However, an increase in the colloidal fraction for LCu and eHS observed at S similar to 6-10 was attributed to possible additional autochthonous (phytoplankton) ligand production. In all dissolved samples, organic complexation kept free Cu below levels potentially toxic for phytoplankton (<1 pmol L-1). Despite increasing anthropogenic activity over the past century, we find Cu concentrations remained similar to the 1970s, suggesting that the large overall river flow may so far minimize the impact of Cu pollution.","[Hollister, Adrienne Patricia; Koschinsky, Andrea] Jacobs Univ Bremen gGmbH, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Whitby, Hannah] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [Seidel, Michael] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Carl von Ossietzky Str 9-11, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Lodeiro, Pablo; Gledhill, Martha] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; [Lodeiro, Pablo] Univ Lleida, Dept Chem, AGROTECNIO CERCA Ctr, Roure 191, Lleida 25198, Spain",,"Hollister, AP (corresponding author), Jacobs Univ Bremen gGmbH, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",a.hollister@jacobs-university.de,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 20,2021.0,234,,,,,,,104005,10.1016/j.marchem.2021.104005,,JUL 2021,,,,,,WOS:000677728400008,

Within the deforestation process, fire is frequently used to eliminate biomass in preparation for agricultural use. Quantifying these deforestation-induced fire emissions represents a challenge, and current estimates are only available at coarse spatial resolution with large uncertainty. Here we developed a biogeochemical model using remote sensing observations of plant productivity, fire activity, and deforestation rates to estimate emissions for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso during 2001-2005. Our model of DEforestation CArbon Fluxes (DECAF) runs at 250-m spatial resolution with a monthly time step to capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity in fire dynamics in our study area within the arc of deforestation, the southern and eastern fringe of the Amazon tropical forest where agricultural expansion is most concentrated. Fire emissions estimates from our modelling framework were on average 90 Tg C year(-1), mostly stemming from fires associated with deforestation (74%) with smaller contributions from fires from conversions of Cerrado or pastures to cropland (19%) and pasture fires (7%). In terms of carbon dynamics, about 80% of the aboveground living biomass and litter was combusted when forests were converted to pasture, and 89% when converted to cropland because of the highly mechanized nature of the deforestation process in Mato Grosso. The trajectory of land use change from forest to other land uses often takes more than one year, and part of the biomass that was not burned in the dry season following deforestation burned in consecutive years. This led to a partial decoupling of annual deforestation rates and fire emissions, and lowered interannual variability in fire emissions. Interannual variability in the region was somewhat dampened as well because annual emissions from fires following deforestation and from maintenance fires did not covary, although the effect was small due to the minor contribution of maintenance fires. Our results demonstrate how the DECAF model can be used to model deforestation fire emissions at relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions. Detailed model output is suitable for policy applications concerned with annual emissions estimates distributed among post-clearing land uses and science applications in combination with atmospheric emissions modelling to provide constrained global deforestation fire emissions estimates. DECAF currently estimates emissions from fire; future efforts can incorporate other aspects of net carbon emissions from deforestation including soil respiration and regrowth.","[van der Werf, G.

We found seasonal trends in visitation for the black agouti (Dasyprocta fuliginosa), red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus), blue-throated piping guan (Pipile cumanensis), red brocket deer (Mazama americana), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), and tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Lunar trends in visitation occurred for the paca (Cuniculus paca), Brazilian porcupine (Coendou prehensilis), and red brocket deer. The probability of recording groups (>1 individual) at mineral licks was seasonal and related to lunar brightness for tapir. Overall, our results provide important context for how elusive species of birds and mammals interact with these key ecological resources on a landscape scale. The ecological importance of mineral licks for these species can provide context to seasonal changes in species occupancy and movement.","[Griffiths, Brian M.] George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Bowler, Mark] Suffolk Univ, Sch Sci Technol & Engn, Ipswich, Suffolk, England; [Bowler, Mark] Suffolk Sustainabil Inst, Ipswich, Suffolk, England; [Gilmore, Michael P.] George Mason Univ, Sch Integrat Studies, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Luther, David] George Mason Univ, Dept Biol, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Luther, David] George Mason Univ, Smithsonian Mason Sch Conservat, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",,"Griffiths, BM (corresponding author), 2 Heather Hill Ln, Elkton, MD 21921 USA.",Bgriffi7@gmu.edu,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020.0,10,24,,,,14152,14164,,10.1002/ece3.7006,,NOV 2020,,,,,,WOS:000588070600001,

It is still often assumed to be a cost-effective climate change mitigation strategy, but this assumption is mostly based on theoretical studies and static opportunity cost calculations. We used spatial and socioeconomic datasets from an Amazonian deforestation frontier in Brazil to construct a simulation model of REDD + payments to households that can be used to assess REDD + interventions. Our SimREDD + model consists of dynamic optimization and land-use/cover change allocation sub-models built into an agent-based model platform. The model assumes that households maximize profit under perfect market conditions and calculates the optimal household land-use/cover configuration at equilibrium under a given REDD + PES scenario. These scenarios include PES based on (1) forest area and (2) carbon stocks. Insights gained from simulations under different conditions can assist in the design of more effective, efficient, and equitable REDD + programs. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Current policies, however, still pursue a development model that is oriented towards global commodity markets and the capacity of well-qualified entrepreneurs with the capital required for large-scale investments, despite a growing consensus on its ecological incompatibilities, social limitations and economic risks. Decision makers from both governmental and non-governmental organisations widely disregard the possibility that smallholders could more actively contribute to rural development. Instead, the production practices of smallholders and their modes of social organisation are perceived as obsolete and inefficient. By presenting examples from the region, this paper argues that smallholders have the potential to manage production systems that maintain environmental stability while effectively contributing to local well-being.

Our case study, carried out in the Beni department of Bolivia, does not contradict this assertion, but shows that collective rights have been granted in areas where ecological contexts and market facilities were less favourable to intensive land use. Previous experiences suggest investigating political processes in order to understand the criteria according to which access rights were distributed. Based on remote sensing and on a multi-level land governance framework, our research confirms that land placed under collective rights, compared to individual property, is less affected by deforestation among Andean settlements. However, analysis of the historical process of land distribution in the area shows that the distribution of property rights is the result of a political process based on economic, spatial, and environmental strategies that are defined by multiple stakeholders. Collective titles were established in the more remote areas and distributed to communities with lower productive potentialities. Land rights are thus a secondary factor of forest cover change which results from diverse political compromises based on population distribution, accessibility, environmental perceptions, and expected production or extraction incomes.

Young people are navigating new dreams, ideas, and desires while mediating expectations to perform and maintain social roles as rural, indigenous, and traditional peoples. In protected areas, rural youth face additional pressure to carry out their role as future environmental stewards. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with riverine inhabitants in the Gurupa-Melgaco Reserve in Para, Brazil, I analyze how young Amazonians negotiate their desires with generational expectations and discourses of traditionality. As small cities urbanize and transportation improves, young people have greater mobility to seek education and employment outside the reserve. Mobile youth continue to contribute to their rural communities in various ways, yet as they interact with urban areas their expectations of rural life are changing. I argue that young Amazonians desire the autonomy to creatively engage with rural and urban areas, diverse livelihoods, technologies, and commodities to both fulfill their aspirations for a good life and to challenge essentialized notions of traditionality.","[Dodd, Lucy M.

However, studies utilizing satellite-measured SIF in South America have concentrated on the Amazonian tropical forest, while SIF in other regions and vegetation classes remain uninvestigated. We examined three years of Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF data for vegetation classes within and across the six Brazilian biomes (Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal) to answer the following: (1) how does satellite-measured SIF differ? (2) What is the relationship (strength and direction) of satellite-measured SIF with canopy temperature (T-can), air temperature (T-air), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)? (3) How does the phenology of satellite-measured SIF (duration and amplitude of seasonal integrated SIF) compare? Our analysis shows that OCO-2 captures a significantly higher mean SIF with lower variability in the Amazon and lower mean SIF with higher variability in the Caatinga compared to other biomes. OCO-2 also distinguishes the mean SIF of vegetation types within biomes, showing that evergreen broadleaf (EBF) mean SIF is significantly higher than other vegetation classes (deciduous broadleaf (DBF), grassland (GRA), savannas (SAV), and woody savannas (WSAV)) in all biomes. We show that the strengths and directions of correlations of OCO-2 mean SIF to T-can, T-air, and VPD largely cluster by biome: negative in the Caatinga and Cerrado, positive in the Pampa, and no correlations were found in the Pantanal, while results were mixed for the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. We found mean SIF most strongly correlated with VPD in most vegetation classes in most biomes, followed by T-can. Seasonality from time series analysis reveals that OCO-2 SIF measurements capture important differences in the seasonal timing of SIF for different classes, details masked when only examining mean SIF differences. We found that OCO-2 captured the highest base integrated SIF and lowest seasonal pulse integrated SIF in the Amazon for all vegetation classes, indicating continuous photosynthetic activity in the Amazon exceeds other biomes, but with small seasonal increases. Surprisingly, Pantanal EBF SIF had the highest total integrated SIF of all classes in all biomes due to a large seasonal pulse. Additionally, the length of seasons only accounts for about 30% of variability in total integrated SIF; thus, integrated SIF is likely captures differences in photosynthetic activity separate from structural differences. Our results show that satellite measurements of SIF can distinguish important functioning and phenological differences in vegetation classes and thus has the potential to improve our understanding of productivity and seasonality in the tropics.","[Merrick, Trina; Jorge, Maria Luisa S.

One goal of the present article is to address the land-use and land-cover decisions of colonist farmers in the Amazon Basin as a function, in part, of household characteristics. Another goal is to generalize the issue of tropical deforestation into a broader discussion on forest dynamics. The extent of secondary forest in tropical areas has been well documented in South America and Africa. Agricultural-plot abandonment often occurs in tandem with primary forest clearance and as part of the same decision-making calculus. Consequently, tropical deforestation and forest succession are not independent processes in the landscape.

We develop a simple method to measure nine ES, identify spatial associations between them, and explore the impact of land use change on the capacity of forests to provide those services. The ES analysed include biodiversity, regional climate regulation, indigenous heritage, agricultural production, and NTFP extraction. Both negative (n= 20) and positive (n= 12) spatial associations are found, with agricultural land and forests having the highest total ES provision. We also show that this varies nonlinearly with distance to forest edges.

In addition, in the Brazilian Amazon, new private agreements were initiated in 2006 and 2009 to limit the purchase of soy and cattle linked with deforestation. One concern is that such policies, because they are spatially heterogeneous or focus on a subset of relevant actors, might generate negative spillovers in the form of leakage of agricultural activities and deforestation to less-regulated areas, and/or a redistribution of non-compliant product sales to non-participants. In this study, we use panel data on soy and beef production and trade in agricultural frontiers of South America to examine how changes in deforestation regulations in South America have altered soy and cattle expansion and exports in this region, and to understand how these changes, if they have occurred, influence the overall effectiveness of deforestation regulations. We find no evidence of a change in soy or pasture area expansion patterns due to changes in regulations, except within the Amazon biome where pasture expansion slowed in response to more stringent regulations and coincided with pasture intensification. We do find, however, a decrease in beef imports from biomes with more stringent deforestation regulations. While this decrease may indicate the existence of leakage to countries outside the study area, it is likely offset by pasture intensification, continued opportunities for deforestation, and increasing domestic consumption from these biomes. These results point to the potential role of substitution effects between local and international consumer markets, and between different actors, in diminishing the overall effectiveness of deforestation regulations.

In Brazil, fire has been traditionally used to convert natural vegetation areas to agricultural lands (slash and burn) and to manage pastures for livestock. We developed the Burned Area Spectral Mixture Analysis (BASMA) algorithm in Google Earth Engine, which is designed to process Landsat data to produce a multi-temporal fire scar database representing annual burned area for an extent of 362,000 km(2) in the transition zone between the Amazon forest and the Cerrado biome. This region is considered a conservation hotspot, given its high deforestation rates over the last four decades. We digitally processed a 32-year time-series (1985 to 2017) of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data to map fire scars based on sub-pixel char fraction, aiming to generate a consistent burned area product at a finer scale and covering a longer period than those currently available for the region. Manually interpreted reference burned area polygons for each annual mosaic was used to guide the definition of the best fire scar endmember and its fraction threshold. To assess our BASMA-delineated fire scar, they were compared to independent datasets of manually delineated burned area produced by visual analysis of finer spatial resolution imagery, returning an average Dice Coefficient value of 0.86. Accuracy was also measured against the 30-meter Burned Area product available at the 'Queimadas' data portal. A total of 11,106,258 ha was mapped as having been affected by fire during the annual dry season over the 32 years, which represents 30.7% of the study region. Results showed a decreasing trend in the annual amount of burned area over the time-series. It reflects a similar pattern shown in the deforestation rate for the Legal Amazon, measured by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research - INPE. Moreover, the Cerrado biome subset of the study region consistently showed higher burned area when compared to the Amazon forest subset. Our findings provide robust evidence that our approach is a consistent method to identify and delineate fire scars for large areas over a long time-series in a very efficient fashion, given the digital processing power of Google Earth Engine, which reduces the time necessary to analyze such big amount of data.","[Daldegan, Gabriel Antunes; Roberts, Dar A.; Ribeiro, Fernanda de Figueiredo] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Daldegan, GA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",gabrie100@ucsb.edu; dar@geog.ucsb.edu; fribeiro@geog.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,15,15,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2019.0,232,,,,,,,111340,10.1016/j.rse.2019.111340,,,,,,,,WOS:000486355300057,

Evidence from long-term flux measurements,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Mangroves play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of coastal and marine ecosystems in the tropics. However, few studies have been carried out to clarify the extent to which mangroves represent a source of nutrients and organic matter for adjacent coastal waters or function, alternatively as a sink. Here we present results of a long-term nutrient-flux study in one of the world's largest mangrove areas in North Brazil. These are up to now the only published nutrient flux data for Brazilian mangroves, and constitute one of the most comprehensive data sets in this field. Throughout 36 tidal cycles in the course of 1 yr, fluxes of organic carbon (DOC, POC), nitrogen (DON, PON) and dissolved inorganic nutrients (N, Si, P compounds) were determined in a tidal creek connecting a clearly defined area of mangroves (2.2 km(2)) with the Caete! Estuary. Additionally, a qualitative whole-estuary approach was applied (190 km(2) of mangroves). Both methods revealed an out-welling of dissolved organic matter and nutrients from the mangroves, exceeding considerably that of mangroves in other regions of the world. This net export was (annual average, mmol [m(2) mangrove](-1) d(-1)) DOC approximate to 10, DON approximate to 0.7, ammonium approximate to 0.2, silicate approximate to 6 and phosphate approximate to 0.02. Nitrate fluxes were comparatively low. Silicate and phosphate were exported mainly during the dry season and DON during the rainy season. DOC showed no seasonal trend. Especially ammonium fluxes presented strong asymmetries between day and night. Although only similar to6 % of the fluvial catchment area is covered by mangroves, their nutrient export exceeded that of the hinterland. The annual export from mangroves on a regional scale (6700 km(2) from 0 degrees S, 50 degreesW to 3 degrees S, 42 degrees W) was estimated (mol yr(-1)) as DOC approximate to 30 x 10(9), DON approximate to 2 x 10(9), ammonium approximate to 0.4 x 10(9), silicate = 15 x 10(9) and phosphate = 0.04 x 10(9). Compared with the Amazon River discharge these fluxes are low (1 to 3 % of the Amazon fluxes). The nutrient cycles of coastal marine environments are probably mangrove-dominated southeast of the Amazon Estuary, contrary to the river-dominated cycles to the northwest.","Zentrum Marine Tropenokol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",,"Dittmar, T (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Meeresforsch, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",tdittmar@awi-bremerhaven.de,,,,,,,94,105,,,,,,,,,,,,2001.0,213,,,,,67,77,,10.3354/meps213067,,,,,,,,WOS:000168704100005,

Tracing major organic matter sources in tropical Brazilian coastal waters,MARINE CHEMISTRY,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"The influence of mangrove-fringed tropical estuaries on coastal carbon budgets has been widely recognised. However, a quantitative differentiation between riverine and mangrove-derived inputs to the dissolved (DOM) and microparticulate organic matter (POM) pool of these environments has been hitherto not possible. Based on lignin-derived phenols and stable carbon isotopes a chemical signature for mangrove, terrestrial and marine-derived organic matter was established for a mangrove estuary in North Brazil. A mixing model was applied to calculate the contribution of each of the three sources to the DOM and POM pool in the estuary throughout 18 tidal cycles in the course of one year. Best source assignment for POM was reached with the yield of lignin phenols and delta C-13 as paired indicators, while the origin of DOM was best identified by the yield of lignin phenols and the acid to aldehyde ratio of vanillyl phenols. Although only about 6% of the fluvial catchment area is covered by mangroves, their contribution to the estuarine DOM and POM pool generally exceeded several times the terrigenic input from the hinterland. This outwelling of mangrove-derived organic matter was enhanced during the rainy season. DOM and POM were exported from the mangrove to the estuary in similar proportions. Most mangrove-POM was rapidly removed from the water column, while mangrove-DOM behaved conservatively. In contrast, terrestrial DOM was almost entirely removed in the outer part of the estuary, which was accompanied by a concomitant increase in terrestrial POM. This seems to be the result of a geochemical barrier zone for this type of DOM in the estuary. Generally, a high proportion of mangrove-DOM was present in the outer part of the estuary, even at high tide. This indicates DOM outwelling from mangroves in adjacent bays or estuaries and points to similar driving forces controlling this process on a regional scale. Mangroves probably play a more important role than rivers for marine carbon budgets along the North Brazilian coast south of the Amazon estuary. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The mining process involves the extraction of gold from ore by burning off a mercury additive, resulting in vaporization of elemental mercury into the surrounding environment. The purpose of this case series is to document mercury levels in miners and local villagers presenting with a history of exposure, or signs and symptoms consistent with mercury toxicity. Over a five year period (1986-91), the whole blood and urine mercury levels of 55 Brazilian patients demonstrating signs and symptoms consistent with mercury exposure were collected. Thirty-three (60%) of the subjects had direct occupational exposure to mercury via gold mining and refining. Whole blood mercury levels ranged from 0.4-13.0 mug/dL (mean 3.05 mug/dL). Spot urine levels ranged 0-151 mug/L (mean = 32.7 mug/L). Occupational mercury exposure is occurring in the Amazon River Basin. Interventions aimed at altering the gold mining process while protecting the workers and surrounding villagers from the source of exposure are essential.

Statistical analysis using 27 years of data showed that the SACZ is most intense when it is over the BP. In this case, low-level cyclonic circulation appears over the southwestern part of the BP and forms westerly flow, which intensifies low-level convergence along the SACZ with northeasterly flow from the Amazon and northerly flow along the western edge of the South Atlantic subtropical high. A vorticity budget analysis indicates that precipitation over the BP that accompanies stretching maintains the cyclonic circulation. Sensitivity experiments using a regional atmospheric model for two different cases indicate that precipitation over the BP plays a dominant role as an atmospheric heat source in maintaining the cyclonic circulation and the SACZ. In model experiments in which rain was stopped around the BP but the topography was kept, the cyclonic circulation disappeared, and the SACZ shifted southward away from its original position. In comparison with a control run, precipitation over the BP was weakened and the SACZ shifted southward in experiments in which the BP was removed or its complex, multiple-valley terrain was smoothed out. The results of this study support the ideas suggested in previous studies (i.e., that the BP has an anchor effect on the SACZ): Precipitation is intensified over the complex terrain of the BP, and mechanisms of conditional instability of the second kind occur between the precipitation over the BP and the cyclonic circulation to its southwest, which intensifies moisture convergence over the plateau.","[Kodama, Yasu-Masa; Sagawa, Tomoyuki; Ishida, Sachinobu] Hirosaki Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368561, Japan; [Yoshikane, Takao] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",,"Kodama, YM (corresponding author), Hirosaki Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368561, Japan.",kodama@cc.hirosaki-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1,2012.0,25,5,,,,1745,1758,,10.1175/2011JCLI3785.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000301315200021,

In this context, and as a remedy against the discrimination suffered by the Afro-Brazilian population since slavery, the state granted rural black communities (so-called quilombolas) the possibility of obtaining special legal status, including the collective ownership of their lands. Since 2006, these communities are also considered protected areas, which underscores their environmental role. This article analyzes and questions certain aspects of Brazilian environmental governance, starting with the quilombola model, which is a variant of a delegated socio-territorial model of managing environmental resources, at once collective and local. Firstly, I am interested in the genesis of this model, from the evolution of environmental management paradigms to the specific Brazilian case. In this section, I present the national and international historical and ideological context by which quilombolas have become crucial actors in the environment debate. Next, I analyze the contemporary realities of environmental governance. For this, and in addition to the standardized discourses, I study the practices of the quilombola communities and the actors with whom they interact. I emphasize how often the environment becomes a political instrument, used in various ways depending on the current paradigms, the actors involved and their own interests, thus leading to certain ambiguities and distortions. Finally, I show how the sustainability of the collective management of resources depends, on one hand, on the domestic economic needs of the quilombolas and, on the other hand, the hierarchical and interdependent power relations that they have long maintained with regional political and economic actors.","[Raimbert, Celine] Ctr Rech & Documentat Amer CREDA, Paris, France; [Raimbert, Celine] IFSTTAR, Dept Amenagement Mobilites & Environm AME, Lab Syst Prod Logist Org Transports & Travail SPL, Champs Sur Marne, France",,"Raimbert, C (corresponding author), Ctr Rech & Documentat Amer CREDA, Paris, France.; Raimbert, C (corresponding author), IFSTTAR, Dept Amenagement Mobilites & Environm AME, Lab Syst Prod Logist Org Transports & Travail SPL, Champs Sur Marne, France.",,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,13,,,,,,,,10.4000/bresils.2522,,,,,,,,WOS:000434871600007,

This study from the Peruvian Amazon includes monthly nitrous oxide and methane fluxes from two cropping systems, three tree-based systems, and a 23-year secondary forest control. Average N(2)O fluxes from the cropping systems were two to three times higher than the secondary forest control (9.1 mug N m(-2) h(-1)), while those of the tree-based systems were similar to the secondary forest. Increased fluxes in the cropping systems were attributed to N fertilization, while fluxes from the tree-based systems were related to litterfall N. Average CH(4) consumption was reduced by up to half that of the secondary forest (-30.0 mug C m(-2) h(-1)) in the tree-based and low-input cropping systems. There was net CH(4) production in the high-input cropping system. This switch to net production was a result of increased bulk density and increased soil respiration resulting in anaerobic conditions. Reduced rates of N(2)O emissions, similar CH(4) consumption, and high C sequestration rates in these tree-based systems compared with mature forests, coupled with the large area of these systems in the humid tropics, may partially offset the past effects of deforestation on increased atmospheric trace gas concentrations. In contrast, cropping systems with higher N(2)O emissions, substantially reduced CH(4) consumption or even net CH(4) emissions, and little C sequestration exacerbate those effects.","Trop Soil Biol & Fertil Programme, Nairobi, Kenya; Int Ctr Res Agroforestry, Lima 12, Peru; USDA ARS, Ft Collins, CO 80522 USA",,"Palm, CA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, 151 Hilgard Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",C.Palm@cgiar.org; J.Alegre@cgiar.org; L.Arevalo@cgiar.org; P.Mutuo@cgiar.org; amosier@lamar.colostate.edu; R.Coe@cgiar.org,,,,,,,49,51,,,,,,,,,,,OCT-NOV,2002.0,16,4,,,,,,1073,10.1029/2001GB001855,,,,,,,,WOS:000180874100021,

Most comparative studies used to interpret these results have relied on poorly provenienced museum samples that are not well-suited to consideration of within species variation in diet. Here we present a study of two species of platyrrhine monkeys, Alouatta belzebul (n = 60) and Sapajus apella (n = 28) from Para State in the Brazilian Amazon in order to assess effects of habitat variation on microwear (each species was sampled from forests that differ in the degree of disturbance from highly disturbed to minimally disturbed). Results indicate that microwear texture values vary between habitats-more for the capuchins than the howler monkeys. This is consistent with the notion that diets of the more folivorous A. belzebul are less affected by habitat disturbance than those of the more frugivorous S. apella. It also suggests that microwear holds the potential to reflect comparatively subtle differences in within-species variation in fossil taxa if sample size and control over paleohabitat allow.

We use a long-term series of standardized line-transect vertebrate censuses conducted throughout the region to illustrate the effects of physical accessibility on wildlife densities in terms of hunting pressure as a function of distance from the nearest point of access. Population abundance in large-bodied, prime-target species preferred by game hunters tended to increase at greater distances from the access matrix, whereas small-bodied species ignored by hunters usually showed the reverse trend. In addition, we estimated the proportion of presumably inviolate core areas within nature, extractive, and indigenous reserves of Brazilian Amazonia that are prohibitively remote and unlikely to be overhunted; for instance, only 1.16% of the basin-wide area is strictly protected on paper and is reasonably safe from extractive activities targeted to game vertebrates and other valuable NTFPs.

Methods A Qualtrics (c) survey including education about BBL was administered on Amazon Mechanical Turk, with inclusion criteria of female sex. Results Survey data from 489 female participants were included. 78.1% of participants found the BBL mortality rate to be higher than expected. 70.1% of the original 177 willing or neutral participants became unwilling to undergo a BBL after education. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that individuals who were more willing to undergo BBL after education were individuals who have a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder (OR 60.5, p = 0.02) or have an acquaintance who received a BBL (OR 230.2, p < 0.01). Conclusions Overall, survey participants were less willing to undergo BBL after learning its risks, indicating the critical role of patient education during informed consent. Additionally, individuals who are unhappy with their body shape, or who feel cultural or social pressure to attain a certain body shape, may accept higher levels of risk to improve their looks, suggesting patient motivation for the procedure may limit even the most effective informed consent process. In light of these findings, the surgical community may consider regulating the BBL procedure and improving safety using evidence-based risk reduction techniques.

While the government has historically promoted the development of forest plantations through economic incentives, state involvement with natural forests has focused on regulation. Over 1 million km(2) in the Legal Amazon have been identified as suitable for the production of forest goods and services and other resource-based activities (Verissimo et al., 2000. p. 6). Only recently, however. has the state taken action to harness the potential this vast public resource holds for promoting sustainable development. In March 2006, the Public Forest Management Law was passed by the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. A key feature of this law is a framework for creating forest concessions on public lands. With the goal of establishing up to 13 million ha of forest concessions by the end of the decade, such an initiative for the development of the forest sector is unprecedented in Brazilian history, marking the state's recognition of the Amazon's vocation as one of forest-based development. A static computable general equilibrium (CCE) model is developed to evaluate the short-run socio-economic and environmental implications of implementing forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon. Results indicate that household income and private consumption increase with the implementation of forest concessions. With the expansion of natural forest management in the north, forest plantations contract significantly in all regions and to a lesser degree, natural forest management in the north east and center west. As forest plantations demand less agricultural land for production, the price of agricultural land decreases and the excess supply is taken up by the agricultural sector which pays less for the land and consequently produces more of a less expensive product. The implementation of forest concessions results in a 3.8% increase in legal deforestation with the largest increase in the north, followed by the north east and center west. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Kim et al. (2012, ) first statistically incorporated a light-controlled phenology module into an ecosystem model to improve carbon flux simulations at one TEF site. However, it is not clear how their approach can be extended to other TEF sites with different climatic conditions. Here we evaluated temporal variability in plant functional traits at three different TEF sites using a data-conditioned stochastic parameterization method. We showed that previously studied links-between seasonal photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the traits V-cmax25 and leaf longevity-occur across sites. We further determined that seasonal PAR could similarly drive variations in the stomatal conductance slope parameter. Differences found in temporal trait estimates among sites indicate that dynamic trait parameters cannot be applied uniformly over space, but it may be possible to extrapolate them based on climatic factors. Motivated by recent observations that physiological capacity develops as leaves mature, we built new regression models for predicting traits that not only include PAR but also an autoregressive lag term to capture observed physiological delays behind PAR-driven phenology shifts. With our stochastic parameterization, we predicted the three sites to be carbon neutral or carbon sinks under the RCP 8.5 future climate scenario. In contrast, projections using standard static trait parameters show most of the Amazonian TEF region becoming a carbon source. We further approximated that variable traits may allow at least a third of the radiation-limited TEF region in the Amazon to serve as a future net carbon sink. Plain Language Summary We implemented a stochastic approach to evaluate the temporal variability of plant traits parameters at three tropical evergreen forest (TEF) sites in the Amazon. Consistent with previous findings, the maximum rate of carboxylation at 25 degrees C (Vcmax25) and leaf longevity were shown to be correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). We additionally found the stomatal conductance slope parameter (mp) to co-vary with seasonal PAR. The spatiotemporal differences in Vcmax25, as well as spatial differences in mp, indicated that straightforward spatial extensions of light-controlled parameterizations may not be possible. We built a regression equation to describe trait dynamics that includes not only PAR but also an autoregressive term to represent a time lag. Using the temporally dynamic trait parameters, we predicted the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) to be neutral or positive at the three TEF sites under a future climate scenario. In contrast, projections with standard static trait parameters showed most of the Amazonian TEF region having negative NEP. In addition, we approximated that at least a third of the radiation-limited TEF region in the Amazon could have positive NEP if dynamic traits were considered.","[Liu, Shaoqing; Ng, Gene-Hua Crystal] Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Ng, Gene-Hua Crystal] Univ Minnesota, St Anthony Falls Lab, Minneapolis, MN USA",,"Liu, SQ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",sqliu@umn.edu,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2021.0,126,6,,,,,,e2020JG006228,10.1029/2020JG006228,,,,,,,,WOS:000666436400023,

Recent advances in satellite observations enable estimates of gross losses of above-ground biomass (AGB) stocks due to deforestation. However, because of simultaneous regrowth, the net contribution of deforestation emissions to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations is poorly quantified. Climate change may also reduce the potential for forest regeneration in previously disturbed regions. Here, we address these points of uncertainty with a machine-learning approach that combines satellite observations of AGB with climate data across the Amazon Basin to reconstruct annual maps of potential AGB during 1993-2012, the above-ground C storage potential of the undisturbed landscape. We derive a 2.2 Pg C loss of AGB over the study period, and, for the regions where these losses occur, we estimate a 0.7 Pg C reduction in potential AGB. Thus, climate change has led to a decline of similar to 1/3 in the capacity of these disturbed forests to recover and recapture the C lost in disturbances during 1993-2012. Our approach further shows that annual variations in land use change mask the natural relationship between the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and AGB stocks in disturbed regions.","[Exbrayat, Jean-Francois; Williams, Mathew] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Exbrayat, Jean-Francois; Williams, Mathew] Univ Edinburgh, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Liu, Yi Y.] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog & Remote Sensing, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Exbrayat, JF (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.; Exbrayat, JF (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",j.exbrayat@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,10,11,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 15,2017.0,7,,,,,,,15615,10.1038/s41598-017-15788-6,,,,,,,,WOS:000415265800026,

Enhanced rain forest conservation efforts toward the end of the twentieth century slowed deforestation of the Amazon but, in turn, increased demand for land repurposing in the adjacent Cerrado (savanna) region, where conservation regulations are less strict. To maintain or increase yields while minimizing the need for additional land, agricultural producers adopted a form of intensification in which two rain-fed crops are planted within a single growing season (double cropping). Using 10 years (August 2002 to July 2012) of MODIS and TRMM data, it is demonstrated that there exists a threshold growing season rainfall amount (1759 mm) for double cropping. But more nuanced is the relationship between observable precipitation information available to farmers at the time of planting decision and the choice to double crop'' in a given year.

The reflectance at a wavelength of 0.64 mum and the drop size, derived from the cloud reflectance at 3.75 mum, are studied for tens of thousands of clouds. The opacity of the smoke layer adjacent to each cloud is also monitored simultaneously. Though from satellite data it is impossible to derive all the parameters that influence cloud properties and smoke-cloud interaction (e.g., detailed aerosol particles size distribution and chemistry, liquid water content. etc.); satellite data can be used to generate large-scale statistics of the properties of clouds and surrounding aerosol (e.g., smoke optical thickness, cloud-drop size, and cloud reflection of solar radiation) from which the interaction of aerosol with clouds can be surmised. In order to minimize the effect of variations in the precipitable water vapor and in other smoke and cloud properties, biomass burning in the tropics is chosen as the study topic. and the results are averaged for numerous clouds with the same ambient smoke optical thickness. It is shown in this study that the presence of dense smoke (an increase in the optical thickness from 0.1 to 2.0) can reduce the remotely sensed drop size of continental cloud drops from 15 to 9 mum. Due to both the high initial reflectance of clouds in the visible part of the spectrum and the presence of graphitic carbon, the average cloud reflectance at 0.64 mum is reduced from 0.71 to 0.68 for an increase in smoke optical thickness from 0.1 to 2.0. The measurements are compared to results from other years, and it is found that, as predicted, high concentration of aerosol particles causes a decrease in the cloud-drop size and that smoke darkens the bright Amazonian clouds. Comparison with theoretical computations based on Twomey's model show that by using the measured reduction in the cloud-drop size due to the presence of smoke it is possible to explain the reduction in the cloud reflectance at 0.64 mum for smoke imagery index of -0.02 to -0.03. Smoke particles are hygroscopic and have a similar size distribution to maritime and anthropogenic sulfuric aerosol particles. Therefore, these results may also be representative of the interaction of sulfuric particles with clouds.","UNIV TOKYO,CTR CLIMATE SYST RES,BUNYO KU,TOKYO 113,JAPAN",,"KAUFMAN, YJ (corresponding author), NASA,GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR,CODE 913,GREENBELT,MD 20771, USA.",,,,,,,,209,221,,,,,,,,,,,APR,1993.0,32,4,,,,729,744,,10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<0729:EOASOC>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993KW38100013,

In this study, we assessed the fire characterization information provided by two major products: the Terra and Aqua MODIS Thermal Anomalies product (MOD14 and MYD14, respectively) and the Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF_ABBA) product derived from GOES East Imager. Using higher spatial resolution imagery data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) instruments, we analyzed the characterization of subpixel fires detected by MOD14, MYD14, and WF_ABBA over parts of Brazilian Amazonia. Our results suggest that MODIS and GOES fire radiative power (FRP) estimates derived for individual fire-pixel clusters are subject to errors due to the effects of the point spread function of those instruments (underestimation of up to 75%), improper fire background characterization (overestimation of up to 80% assuming a 10 K cold bias in background temperature), and omission of small fire lines.

Detailed palynological studies on new sediment cores located on a transect from southern to northern Brazil allow a regional reconstruction of late Quaternary vegetation and climate history. This paper presents an overview and a paleoclimatic synthesis based on 10 paleoecological records from Brazil. Several changes within different vegetation types and shifts of vegetation belts during glacial and Holocene times were found. Pollen records from the south Brazilian highlands demonstrate that campos vegetation extended from glacial to early Holocene times which was replaced by Araucaria forests only during the late Holocene. Records from the southeast Brazilian lowlands and highlands show a replacement of modern tropical semideciduous forests and cerrado vegetation by subtropical grasslands and gallery forests during the last glacial period, indicating a relatively dry climate with a longer annual dry season and a cold climate with frosts. Some areas of cerrado were replaced by semideciduous forests in southeastern Brazil only in the last millennium. During the early Holocene a longer annual dry season is found in southern and in southeastern Brazil. The latest Holocene period is the wettest since the Last Glacial Maximum for which the shortest dry season has bee inferred. Pollen records near the Amazon mouth indicate palaeovegetation of non analog composition and changes in Amazon rain forest during the late-glacial and early Holocene. Evidence of Podocarpus pollen indicates cooler conditions during the late-glacial.

Extraction for some resources has reached such proportions that evidence is measurable from space. We present recent evidence of the global demand for a single commodity and the ecosystem destruction resulting from commodity extraction, recorded by satellites for one of the most biodiverse areas of the world. We find that since 2003, recent mining deforestation in Madre de Dios, Peru is increasing nonlinearly alongside a constant annual rate of increase in international gold price (similar to 18%/yr). We detect that the new pattern of mining deforestation (1915 ha/year, 2006-2009) is outpacing that of nearby settlement deforestation. We show that gold price is linked with exponential increases in Peruvian national mercury imports over time (R-2 = 0.93, p = 0.04, 2003-2009). Given the past rates of increase we predict that mercury imports may more than double for 2011 (similar to 500 t/year). Virtually all of Peru's mercury imports are used in artisanal gold mining. Much of the mining increase is unregulated/artisanal in nature, lacking environmental impact analysis or miner education. As a result, large quantities of mercury are being released into the atmosphere, sediments and waterways. Other developing countries endowed with gold deposits are likely experiencing similar environmental destruction in response to recent record high gold prices.

We develop and extend a Faustmann model to explore the effects of insecure property rights and unsustainability on the migrant's decision to convert tropical forestland to crop production, to maintain it for long-term timber production, or to mine the forest for timber and then abandon the land. We then provide a numerical simulation of the migrant's land-use decision based on data from the Amazon to compare the returns to mahogany plantation as opposed to agricultural conversion or timber mining. Increasing insecurity of land tenure leads to a decline in the value of timber relative to agricultural production land, thus creating an incentive for forest conversion. However, when land is easily degraded and tenure insecurity is high, timber mining and land abandonment may be a particular problem. Finally, we examine the role of private and government investment in establishing and maintaining secure land tenure. Once government arrives at the frontier, it can encourage sustainable timber production through providing secure harvesting rights and setting an optimal concession fee.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",,"Barbier, EB (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, POB 3985, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",,,,,,,,28,28,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2001.0,47,4,,,,497,509,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000172049900007,

Logging operations vary in timing, location, and intensity. Evidence of this land use is rapidly obscured by forest regeneration and ongoing deforestation. A detailed study of selective logging operations was conducted near Sinop, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, one of the key Amazonian logging centers. An 11-yr series of annual Lansdat images ( 1992 - 2002) was used to detect and track logged forests across the landscape. A semiautomated method was applied and compared to both visual interpretation and field data. Although visual detection provided precise delineation of some logged areas, it missed many areas. The semiautomated technique provided the best estimates of logging extent that are largely independent of potential user bias. Multitemporal analyses allowed the authors to analyze the annual variations in logging and deforestation, as well as the interaction between them. It is shown that, because of both rapid regrowth and deforestation, evidence of logging activities often disappeared within 1-3 yr. During the 1992 - 2002 interval, a total of 11 449 km(2) of forest was selectively logged. Around 17% of these logged forests had been deforested by 2002. An intra-annual analysis was also conducted using four images spread over a single year. Nearly 3% of logged forests were rapidly deforested during the year in which logging occurred, indicating that even annual monitoring will underestimate logging extent. Great care will need to be taken when inferring logging rates from observations greater than a year apart because of the partial detection of previous years of logging activity.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observ, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA",,"Matricardi, EAT (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observ, 1405 S Harrison Rd,Room 101, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.",matricar@msu.edu,,,,,,,26,26,,,,,,,,,,,,2005.0,9,,,,,,,24,,,,,,,,,WOS:000241358200001,

Independent and paired t-tests were used to identify changes in nutritional status over time in the larger sample and smaller, longitudinal subsample, respectively. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine the relationship between changes in economic/living conditions and nutritional status in the longitudinal subsample. Results indicate modest improvements in linear growth (HAZ) and among male children the observed increase was related to enrollment in the Brazilian conditional cash transfer program, Bolsa Familia (P = 0.03). In terms of short-term measures of nutritional status, we found a significant increase in ZTSF and a reduction in ZUMA in most age/sex groups. Among subadults, there was a negative relationship between ZUMA and access to electricity (P = 0.01) and positive relationship between ZUMA and the sale of the acai fruit (P = 0.04). Significant changes in weight and BMI (P < 0.01) were found among adult females and both were negatively related to household cash income (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively). Despite significant changes in economic strategies and lifestyle, changes in nutritional status were modest which may be explained by increased food insecurity documented during this early stage of transition.

Within Gastrotheca, the earliest diverging clade is confined to northeastern Brazil, whereas the three subsequent diverging lineages are restricted to northern Venezuela (G. walked), southeastern Brazil, and northwestern South America. All species in these clades inhabit humid forests at low to mid-elevations, and their life histories are characterized by lacking free-living tadpoles (i.e., direct development). Two derived clades inhabit the Andes, and both contain species with either direct development or tadpoles. One Andean clade of Gastrotheca ranges in the high Andes from Colombia to extreme northern Peru, whereas the other clade inhabits high elevations in the Andes of southern Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, and lower elevations in the Andes of northwestern Argentina.

My argument picks up on earlier readings that see it as allegorizing the decline of the aura of art- a process I connect to a shift in the regional dynamics of capital accumulation in Brazil, showing how the aestheticist cult of beauty was associated with the export economy and a mode of uneven development most dramatically exemplified by the Amazonian rubber boom.

Among the structural and textural features important for the discussion of the origin of the Belterra Clay are the sharp contact between the clay cover and the underlying laterite as well as conglomeritic/brecciate textures and occasional bedding structure in the upper part of the lateritic crust. The detailed analyses do not permit definite conclusions on the origin of the Belterra Clay. Three hypotheses ar discussed: 1. In-situ formation of the clay cover by weathering processes. 2. Clay deposition after lateral transport of saprolitic material coming from former elevations inside or outside the present laterite areas. 3.

These commitments offer much promise for sustainable commodity production, but are undermined by a lack of transparency about their coverage and impacts. Here, using state-of-the-art supply chain data, we introduce an approach to evaluate the impact of ZDCs, linking traders and international markets to commodity-associated deforestation in the sub-national jurisdictions from which they source. We focus on the Brazilian soy sector, where we find that ZDC coverage is increasing, but under-represents the Cerrado biome where most soy-associated deforestation currently takes place. Though soy-associated deforestation declined in the Amazon after the introduction of the Soy Moratorium, we observe no change in the exposure of companies or countries adopting ZDCs to soy-associated deforestation in the Cerrado. We further assess the formulation and implementation of these ZDCs and identify several systematic weaknesses that must be addressed to increase the likelihood that they achieve meaningful reductions in deforestation in future. As the 2020 deadline for several of these commitments approaches, our approach can provide independent monitoring of progress toward the goal of ending commodity-associated deforestation.","[zu Ermgassen, Erasmus K.

Two chronosequences were selected. One chronosequence consisted of a forest and pasture established in 1989, 1987, 1983, 1979 and 1972. The main soil type in this area is the red yellow podzolic latosol (Kandiudult). The second chronosequence consisted of a forest site and pasture established in 1987, 1983, 1972 and 1911, and the main soil type is a red yellow podzolic soil (Paleudult, Tropudult). The first soil type is the most base-depleted soil and has a higher clay content than the second one. Despite the initial differences in clay and cations contents between the forest sites the total soil carbon content at 0-30 cm in both forest were circa 3.7 kg C m(-2). After pasture installation soil bulk density were higher in the first 0-5 cm soil layer, mainly in one chronosequence but small changes were detected in deeper soil layers. Forest conversion to pasture caused appreciable increases in soil pH and exchangeable cation content, at least until nine years after pasture installation. pH levels were greater in the first chronosequence, with highest values (6.8 to 7.6) found in 3 and 5 years old pastures respectively. In the most base-depleted soil Ca content increased from 0.07 kg m(-2) in the forest site to 0.25 kg m(-2) in the 5 year old pasture. After normalization by clay content total soil carbon contents to 30 cm in the 20 year old pastures were 17 to 20% higher than in the original forest sites. Calculations of carbon derived from forest (Cdf) and from pasture (Cdp) using soil delta(13)C values showed that Cdf decrease sharply in the first 9 years after pasture establishment in both chronosequences and reached stable values of 2.12 kg C m(-2) and 2.02 kg C m(-2) in chronosequences 1 and 2, respectively. Soil carbon derived from pasture increased with time and represented 50% of total soil carbon in the top 30 cm after 20 years of pasture. In general we observed that forest conversion to pasture is associated to a pattern of increasing of soil cations and pH levels for at least 5 years under pasture establishment. The removal of the original forest for pasture establishment resulted in an accumulation of carbon derived from pasture in the soil.","ORSTOM,F-93140 BONDY,FRANCE",,"deMoraes, JFL (corresponding author), UNIV SAO PAULO,CTR ENERGIA NUCL AGR,CP 96,BR-13400970 PIRACICABA,BRAZIL.",,,,,,,,181,194,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,1996.0,70,1,,,,63,81,,10.1016/0016-7061(95)00072-0,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UK48500005,

Proponents of jurisdictional REDD+ argue that the approach brings more social and environmental benefits than small-scale REDD+ projects and addresses negative socio-economic impacts of deforestation pressures on forest-dependent communities. Our analysis tells a different story. We assess Acre's sub-national jurisdictional (SNJ) program to show that reworking the scale of REDD+ is not only key to its persistence and stabilization, but also that implementation politics often further environmental injustice. We draw qualitative field research in the state of Acre into conversation with a critical analysis of SISA and the ISA Carbon program implementation. Our findings illustrate two interwoven points vital to political ecologies of REDD+. First, the social-environmental ambitions of Acre's SNJ REDD+ program were strongly influenced by the political ecologies of popular movements and a history of state-led environmental governance initiatives. Second, Acre's SNJ REDD+ has not met several of its social-environmental goals like bolstering forest-dependent peoples' rights or equitably distributing program benefits across sectors, despite operating most extensively on the lands of forest-dependent communities. Consequently, we argue that Acre's SNJ REDD+ track record has reinforced rather than alleviated injustice against Indigenous peoples and traditional forest extractivist communities.","[da Silva, Marcelo Santos Rocha] Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Correia, Joel] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"da Silva, MSR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",msantosrochadasilv@ucmerced.edu; joel.correia@latam.ufl.edu,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2022.0,29,,,,,123,142,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000780012300002,

A computer-assisted visual interpretation procedure was employed to analyze images, and linear multispectral transformation was applied in selected subscenes in order to improve information extraction. The results indicate that high-resolution satellite imagery is generally compatible with the scale of the environmental problems in Amazonia and is a very efficient source of detailed information at a local scale on many aspects of the environment, in particular for monitoring changes over time in selected areas.

The financial mechanism of REDD+ is payment for the ecosystem service of carbon sequestration in tropical forests that is expected to create incentives for conservation of forest cover and condition. However, the costs of achieving emissions reduction by these means remain largely unknown. We assess the set-up, implementation, and monitoring costs, i.e., collectively the transaction costs, of six of the first seven REDD+ project designs from the Peruvian Amazon and compare them with established projects in Brazil and Bolivia. The estimated costs vary greatly among the assessed projects from US$0.16 to 1.44 ha-1 yr-1, with an average of US$0.73 ha-1 yr-1, though they are comparable to earlier published estimates. The results indicate that the costs of implementing REDD+ are highly uncertain for participating developing countries because of issues such as inadequate project design and how additionality is determined. Furthermore, some insight is obtained into how different activities to reduce deforestation and forest degradation, the type of implementer, and project location affect implementation costs of REDD+ projects. Even with these first estimates, the cost of preserving existing intact forests in the Peruvian Amazon may have been underestimated.","[Thompson, Olivia R.

Stations with 30 or more years of uninterrupted and reliable recordings are very few, considering the size of the region, and most of them are located along the major rivers. It has been suggested that rainfall conditions away from these rivers are substantially different. An analysis has been made of the records of a network of simple pluviometric sites in the Brazilian part of the region as maintained by the National Agency for Electric Energy (ANEEL) since 1970. The latter data sets were used to draw more detailed maps on annual rainfall, and on the strength of the dry season in particular; average number of consecutive months with less than 100 mm, 50 mm, and 10 mm, respectively. Also, some data were obtained on the spatial expression of El Nino events within the region. Subregional differences are large, and it is argued that they are important for the success or failure of agricultural settlements; for the hazard of large-scale fire damage of the still existing primary forest vegetation; for the functioning of this land cover as stock and sink Of CO2, and for the likelihood that secondary forests on abandoned agricultural lands will have less biomass.

Recent government policy, the projected growth of agriculture, and the expansion of the cattle industry are expected to further pressure primates within the Amazon basin. In this study, we examined the anthropogenic impact on the widely distributed black-headed night monkey, Aotus nigriceps, whose distribution and population status have yet to be assessed. We (1) modeled potential species distribution in A. nigriceps, (2) estimated the impact of habitat loss on population trends, and (3) highlight landscape-based conservation actions that maximize the potential for their long-term sustainability. We found the black-headed night monkey to be restricted by several biotic and environmental factors including forest cover, isothermality, precipitation, temperature, and elevation. Over the last two decades, over 132,908 km(2) of tree cover (18%) has been lost within their currently recognized range based on satellite imagery. Based on a balance training omission, predicted area, and threshold values (BPTP), suitable habitat was only 67% (1,069,948 km(2)) of their hypothesized range, a loss of 16.5% from 2000, with just nearly a third of suitable habitat currently within protected areas. Over the last two decades, an estimated minimum 1.6 million individuals have been lost due to loss of suitable habitat. Projected deforestation rates equate to an additional loss of 94,458 km(2) of suitable habitat over the next decade. Although classified as a species of Least Concern, we suggest that A. nigriceps may likely be more at risk than previously described. The future impact of the continued expansion of monoculture crops, cattle ranching, and wildfires is still unknown.

Methods: We investigated the floral biology and pollination of M. flexuosa in undisturbed forest, undisturbed savanna/forest ecotone, and fragmented savanna within plantations of the exotic tree, Acacia mangium, in northern Brazilian Amazonia. In each habitat, we examined floral biology, combined floral visitor observations with laboratory analyses, and performed anemophily and exclusion experiments. Key results: Fruit set was significantly greater in the visitor exclusion treatment than in the wind + visitor exclusion treatment and significantly lower in the wind + visitor exclusion treatment than the open control, but there was no difference in fruit set between the visitor exclusion treatment and the control. We found no significant difference in pollen dispersal among the three habitats. The presence of A. mangium appears to have no immediate effect on pollination of M. flexuosa, although it may indirectly affect other aspects of this native's reproductive ecology. Conclusions: Floral visitors of M. flexuosa are not pollinators. This dioecious palm depends on wind as its primary pollen vector. Wind pollination is not necessarily most effective in open habitats. These findings are important because they re-evaluate traditional assumptions of wind pollination and can improve management strategies of this natural resource in the Amazon.","[Rosa, Roxaneh Khorsand; Koptur, Suzanne] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA",,"Rosa, RK (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Modesto Maidique Campus, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",rkhor001@fiu.edu,,,,,,,18,19,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2013.0,100.0,3,,,,613,621,,10.3732/ajb.1200446,,,,,,,,WOS:000315571900015,

Further, across regions and time, strategies respond to pressures (deforestation and political). We estimate deforestation impacts of PA types for a critical frontier, the Brazilian Amazon. We separate regions and time periods that differ in their deforestation and political pressures and document considerable variation in PA strategies across regions, time periods and types. The siting of PAs varies across regions. For example, all else being equal, PAs in the arc of deforestation are relatively far from non-forest, while in other states they are relatively near. Internal deforestation varies across time periods, e.g. it is more similar across the PA types for PAs after 2000. By contrast, after 2000, PA extent is less similar across PA types with little non-indigenous area created inside the arc. PA strategies generate a range of impacts for PA types-always far higher within the arc-but not a consistent ranking of PA types by impact.","[Pfaff, Alexander; Herrera, Diego] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Robalino, Juan; Sandoval, Catalina] Ctr Agron Trop Invest & Ensenanza, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Robalino, Juan] Univ Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica",,"Pfaff, A (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",alex.pfaff@duke.edu,,,,,,,38,38,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 5,2015.0,370.0,1681,,,,,,20140273,10.1098/rstb.2014.0273,,,,,,,,WOS:000362720200005,

Due to the massive exploitation in the past decades, however, mahogany supplies have diminished to the point that the Brazilian government has recently ordered a complete harvesting stop. To counter the threat to its survival, intensive efforts were started in the past years to study fundamentals for sustainable management plantations of this species. In this context, the colonization of the fine roots by mycorrhizal fungi in plantation trees and seedlings raised in nurseries is of great importance for sustainable growth. In order to study the environmental requirements of mahogany, experimental plantations were established 1991 to 1993 on the poor latosol sites of the terra firme near Manaus/Amazon. Without exception, mycorrhiza developed intensively under plantation conditions and also in the 20-month-old seedlings cultivated under controlled conditions. Mycorrhizal structures of the Arum-type vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) were found, with appressoria penetration and coiled hyphae, vesicles and arbuscules. The colonization of the fine roots with mycorrhizal fungi was restricted to the root zone with an active rhizodermis where suberization and a U-shaped secondary wall including lignification of the exodermis was not yet developed. From the secondary stage of the exodermis onwards the uptake of water and mineral elements is maintained by specialized passage cells. This adaptation strategy to the specific conditions of a dry season is seen as a characteristic feature of the fine roots of Swietenia macrophylla. Considering also the results of parallel investigations on the fine root structure, the water and mineral element cycling, and photosynthesis, mahogany can be recommended for sustainable production of high-quality timber under plantation conditions.","Univ Hamburg, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany",,"Noldt, G (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Leuschnerstr 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2001.0,75.0,3-4,,,,168,172,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000171008900015,

Previous studies of Cerrado land-use and land-cover (LULC) change imply spatial homogeneity, report widely varying rates of land conversion, use ambiguous LULC categories, and generally do not attempt to validate results. This study addresses this gap in the literature by analyzing moderate-resolution, multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data from 1986 to 2002 in two regions with identical underlying drivers. Unsupervised classification by the ISODATA algorithm indicates that Cerrado was converted to agro-pastoral land covers in 31% (3646km(2)) of the study region in western Bahia and 24% (3011 km(2)) of the eastern Mato Grosso study region, while nearly 40% (4688 km(2) and 5217 km(2), respectively) of each study region remained unchanged. Although aggregate land change is similar, large and contiguous fragments persist in western Bahia, while smaller fragments remain in eastern Mato Grosso. These findings are considered in the current context of Cerrado land-use policy, which is dominated by the conservation set-aside and command-control policy models. The spatial characteristics of Cerrado remnants create considerable obstacles to implement the models; an alternative approach, informed by countryside biogeography, may encourage collaboration between state officials and farmer-landowners toward conservation land-use policies.

This research strategy offers a solid foundation for perspectives into the future. The laboratory is the Brazilian Amazon, one of the hotspots of land-use change where local and global interests both collide and converge: local livelihoods are affected by regional and global climate change and by the loss of biodiversity caused by local and global economic interests in agro-industrial land use; such use contributes, in turn, to climate change. After decades of diverse policy interventions the question arises: What can we learn from past trajectories for a more sustainable development in the future? To answer this question, we combined qualitative story lines for the region, reviewed by local experts, with quantitative land-use scenarios, to study their regional and local manifestations in space. These results were then discussed again with local and national experts. Our findings suggest that in-depth knowledge of the diverging perspectives at a very local level is a fundamental prerequisite for downscaling global scenarios and upscaling local approaches to sustainable land-use management and thus, to producing communicable and applicable results.","[Schoenenberg, Regine] Free Univ Berlin, Latin Amer Inst, Berlin, Germany; [Schaldach, Ruediger; Goepel, Jan] Univ Kassel, CESR, Kassel, Germany; [Lakes, Tobia; Gollnow, Florian] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany",,"Schonenberg, R (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Latin Amer Inst, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,22.0,3,,,,,,13,10.5751/ES-09032-220313,,,,,,,,WOS:000412944300001,

Here we consider an important, yet largely overlooked, driver of South America's soybean expansion, namely the devaluation of local currencies against the US dollar in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Much interest has emerged in recent years over the environmental implications of soybean production in Brazil, with evidence of both direct incursions into moist tropical forest by soybean producers and of potential indirect effects, via the displacement of existing ranching operations. In this research we utilize historical trends in soybean prices, exchange rates, and cropland dedicated to soybean production in Bolivia. Paraguay, and Brazil to estimate the impact of currency devaluations on area of production. The results suggest that approximately 80,000 km(2), or 31% of the current extent of soybean production in these countries, emerged as a supply area response to the devaluation of local currencies in the late 1990s. The results also indicate that the more recent depreciation of the dollar and appreciation of the Brazilian real have counteracted a recent rise in global soybean prices, in the process sparing an estimated nearly 90,000 km(2) from new cropland, 40,000 km(2) of this in the Amazon alone. Amidst an increasingly neoliberal economic environment, where barriers to trade are jettisoned in favor of the free flow of commodities, relative currency values will occupy an important role in the future sourcing of both agricultural expansion and environmental degradation.

A large decrease of OCpetro content in riverine sediments is observed from the outlet of the Andes to the mouth of the large tributaries. This loss reveals oxidation of OCpetro during transfer of sediments in the floodplain, and results in an escape of similar to 0.25 Mt C/yr to the atmosphere, which is on the same order of magnitude as the CO2 consumption by silicate weathering in the same area.

Additionally, integration of blended spectral indices in the immediate post-fire evaluation and the generation of fire severity were analysed. The blended bands presented correlation and Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values that were consistently higher than 0.819 and root mean square error values of less than 0.027, which confirms good accuracy levels obtained from the model. Similar correlation and SSIM accuracy levels were observed in the blended indices assessment for both study sites, which enables its values to be well-integrated for an analysis of the immediately post-fire date.

This article addresses the role of small-scale gold mining in urbanization, by focusing on local processes in two mining settlements in the Tapajos Mineral Province: CreporizAo and Creporizinho. This analysis addresses why mobility and temporary settlement, which are traditional characteristics of small-scale gold mining, are gradually giving way to longer stays in these mining settlements. Over the years, irregular mining settlements have evolved into formalized villages. These settlements attract increasing numbers of families and service providers. This transition from an irregular and provisional settlement to a more stable and formalized one is not a unilateral process, but takes shape through the interaction of local and informal initiatives and passive-reactive local and federal governments. In addition, settlement permanence is to a large extent constructed around the notion of a garimpeiro community in which small-scale gold mining lies at the root of a collectively formed identity. In these villages, links with regional urban centers such as Santarem and Itaituba remain strong. In the context of urban development in the region, CreporizAo and Creporizinho can still be seen as mining villages, where settlement remains a strategic choice and a stage in the life trajectory of its inhabitants.","[Kolen, Judith; de Smet, Eline; de Theije, Marjo] Ctr Latin Amer Res & Documentat CEDLA, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [de Theije, Marjo] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Kolen, J (corresponding author), Ctr Latin Amer Res & Documentat CEDLA, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2018.0,23.0,1,,,,169,188,,10.1111/jlca.12271,,,,,,,,WOS:000427598100011,

The spatial scale of an offset scheme may influence which of these 2 outcomes is favored and is an important aspect of the scheme's design. However, how spatial scale influences the trade-offs between the preservation of existing habitat and restoration of degraded areas is poorly understood. We used the largest forest offset scheme in the world, which is part of the Brazilian Forest Code, to explore how implementation at different spatial scales may affect the outcome in terms of the area of avoided deforestation and area of regrowth. We employed a numerical simulation of trade between buyers (i.e., those who need to offset past deforestation) and sellers (i.e., landowners with exceeding native vegetation) in the Brazilian Amazon to estimate potential avoided deforestation and regrowth at different spatial scales of implementation. Allowing offsets over large spatial scales led to an area of avoided deforestation 12 times greater than regrowth, whereas restricting offsets to small spatial scales led to an area of regrowth twice as large as avoided deforestation. The greatest total area (avoided deforestation and regrowth combined) was conserved when the spatial scale of the scheme was small, especially in locations that were highly deforested. To maximize conservation gains from avoided deforestation and regrowth, the design of the Brazilian forest-offset scheme should focus on restricting the spatial scale in which offsets occur. Such a strategy could help ensure conservation benefits are localized and promote the recovery of degraded areas in the most threatened forest landscapes.","[Giannichi, Marta Lisli; Gavish, Yoni; Baker, Timothy R.; Ziv, Guy] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Giannichi, Marta Lisli; Dahmer, Martin] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Maths Earth & Environm Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",,"Giannichi, ML (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.; Giannichi, ML (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Maths Earth & Environm Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",martagiannichi@gmail.com,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2020.0,34.0,1,,,,148,157,,10.1111/cobi.13362,,JUL 2019,,,,,,WOS:000481436900001,

This study compared the isotopic composition of N2O emitted from soils under different tree species in the Brazilian Amazon. We also compared the effect of tree species with that of soil moisture, as we expected the latter to be the main factor regulating the proportion of nitrifier- and denitrifier-derived N2O and, consequently, isotopic signatures of N2O. Tree species significantly affected delta(15)N in nitrous oxide. However, there was no evidence that the observed variation in delta(15)N in N2O was determined by varying proportions of nitrifier- vs. denitrifier-derived N2O. We submit that the large variation in delta(15)N-N2O is the result of competition between denitrifying and immobilizing microorganisms for NO3-. In addition to altering delta(15)N-N2O, tree species affected net rates of N2O emission from soil in laboratory incubations. These results suggest that tree species contribute to the large isotopic variation in N2O observed in a range tropical forest soils. We found that soil water affects both N-15 and O-18 in N2O, with wetter soils leading to more depleted N2O in both N-15 and O-18. This is likely caused by a shift in biological processes for N-15 and possible direct exchange of O-18 between H2O and N2O.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; Inst Forest SB RAS, Krasnoyarsk, Russia; Univ Bayreuth, Dept Soil Sci & Soil Geog, Bayreuth, Germany; Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, Bayreuth, Germany",,"Menyailo, OV (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",menyailo@hotmail.com,,,,,,,16,19,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2003.0,39.0,1,,,,41,52,,10.1080/1025601031000096745,,,,,,,,WOS:000182883600005,

Despite common belief that the language possesses contrastive nasal vowels, literature examination shows that nasal vowels may be followed by a nasal resonance, while nasalized vowels must be followed by a nasal consonant. It is argued that the nasal resonance may be the remains of a consonant that nasalizes the vowel, making nasal vowels simply coarticulatorily nasalized (e.g. [1]). If so, vowel nasality should not be more informative for the perception of a word containing a nasal vowel than for a word containing a nasalized vowel, as nasality is attributed to coarticulation. To test this hypothesis, randomized stimuli containing the first syllable of words with oral, nasal and nasalized vowels were presented to BP listeners who had to identify the stimuli original word. Preliminary results demonstrate that accuracy decreased for nasal and nasalized stimuli. A comparison between patterns of response to measured degrees of vowel acoustic nasality and formant values demonstrate that vowel quality differences may play a more relevant role in word identification than type of nasality in a vowel.","[Marques, Luciana; Scarborough, Rebecca] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Marques, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",luciana.marques@colorado.edu; rebecca.scarborough@colorado.edu,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,,,,,,616,620,,10.21437/Interapeech.2017-570,,,,,,,,WOS:000457505000125,
721,6245,J,"Macauley, C",,,,"Macauley, C",,,Aggressive active case detection: a malaria control strategy based on the Brazilian model,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Since 1996, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has adopted a malaria control strategy known as aggressive active case detection (AACD) in which most or all members of every community are tested and treated for malaria on a monthly basis. The strategy attempts to identify and treat cases of asymptomatic malaria, which, if untreated, continue to transmit the infection. Malaria remains uncontrolled because almost all health care systems in the world rely on passive case detection: the treatment of only symptomatic cases of malaria. Research has shown conclusively that asymptomatic cases exist in any population where malaria transmission is stable and incidence is high: therefore passive case detection simply will not succeed in breaking the cycle of transmission. Numerous case studies show that malaria has been successfully controlled on a regional or national level by mass blood surveys. AACD is an effective malaria control strategy if used in conjunction with other methods, especially when (1) an effective treatment exists, (2) influx of potential carriers of the infection can be monitored, and (3) people are inclined to cooperate with monthly blood testing. AACD requires access to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), microscopy supplies, extensive human resources, and prompt, affordable, and effective treatment. AACD is compared to PCD in terms of clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness in a case study of malaria in the Brazilian Yanomami Indians. Where it is feasible, AACD could drastically reduce the incidence of malaria and should be an integral part of the World Health Organization's Roll Back Malaria strategy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, few studies have quantified total biomass of plant communities in this ecosystem, particularly the belowground component; a C pool of potential global significance. Total biomass (aboveground and belowground), and the quantity of biomass consumed by fires were measured in four plant communities comprising a vegetation gradient from pure grassland (campo limpo) to a woodland with a closed canopy of tall shrubs and scattered trees (cerrado dense) near Brasilia, DF, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) increased along this gradient from 5.5 Mg ha(-1) in campo limpo to 29.4 Mg ha(-1) in cerrado dense. Vegetation structure varied among communities; trees were nonexistent in campo limpo, but were at a density of 1000 ha(-1) and a biomass of 12.9 Mg ha(-1) in cerrado dense. Fires consumed 92 and 84% of the TAGB in campo limpo (pure grassland) and campo sujo (savanna), respectively. In cerrado aberto and cerrado dense, trees and tall shrubs were little affected by fire. Combustion factors of the TAGB in these communities was 54 and 33%, respectively. The total biomass consumed by fire ranged from 5.0 Mg ha(-1) in campo limpo to 13.5 Mg ha(-1) in cerrado aberto. Compared to other widespread Brazilian ecosystems (tropical dry forest and evergreen forest), the Cerrado has a lower aboveground biomass. The TAGB of cerrado dense is < 9% of that of Amazonian tropical evergreen forest. The total quantity of biomass consumed by fire, and hence emissions td the atmosphere is lower in intact Cerrado communities compared to fires in slashed tropical forest. Total belowground biomass (TBGB) increased from 16.3 Mg ha(-1) in campo limpo, to 30.1 Mg ha(-1) in campo sujo, to 46.5 Mg ha(-1) in cerrado aberto, and to 52.9 Mg ha(-1) in cerrado dense. This quantity of belowground biomass is similar to, or exceeds that reported for many tropical dry and moist forests. More than 80% of the TBGB occurred in the upper 30 cm of the soil, except for cerrado dense (71%) where a greater proportion of tree roots were present at deeper levels. Root:shoot ratios were very high in all sites ranging from 2.9 in cerrado dense to 7.7 in campo sujo. Total ecosystem plant biomass (the total aboveground biomass and TBGB combined) ranged from 21.9 Mg ha(-1) in campo limpo to 77.9 Mg ha(-1) in cerrado dense. More than 71% of the live phytomass (aboveground biomass + root biomass) is belowground in the Brazilian Cerrado. At current rates of land cover change in the Brazilian Cerrado, these ecosystem pools are likely significant sources of increasing atmospheric C and other greenhouse gasses.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,"De Castro, EA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,,144,150,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,1998.0,14.0,,3,,,263,283,,10.1017/S0266467498000212,,,,,,,,WOS:000074913400001,

When they began to be expulsed, a political resistance, often guided by the Catholic Church, appeared as well as the creation of unions based on traditional identities, especially that of rubber tappers. During the 1980s, these unions made a strategic alliance with the ecologist movement which started to consider traditional populations, whose lifestyle depended on the forest, as allies for the protection of the Amazon rainforest. The movement gained a decisive momentum at the end of the decade by putting forward new proposals of land tenure for traditional populations, grounded on collective land rights. This strategy has been very efficient during the 1990s and 2000s, during which about 1,300,000 km(2) of rainforest were set apart and reserved for the use of traditional communities under a variety of legal status. But it has also led to mix under the same collective etiquette and principles a number of different ways of using and managing land and natural resources. This assumption however should be nuanced by a careful analysis of the resource management systems existing in each case, for they are in general complex and mix varying proportions of individual and collective decisions. The aim of this paper is to explore this question using the example of the Chico Mendes agroextractive settlement (PAE-CM), inhabited by about 100 rubber tapper families and symbolic of the political struggle of traditional populations in the Amazon for being the home of the rubber tapper leader Chico Mendes assassinated in 1988. Applying Ostrom design principles, we try to catch what are the local institutional arrangements and to see if they suggest collective or individual management, and what the boundaries between both categories are. As a conclusion, we find that the PAE-CM's system is much less collective than expected, and also very much controlled by external authorities, in a logic pretty much away from the idea of a CPR system. This finding is useful to understand the shortcomings in the actual management of the PAE but also to foresee difficulties which will probably arise in the management of many of the areas which have gained collective land rights or collective management statutes in the Amazon.","[Le Tourneau, Francois-Michel] Univ Arizona, UMI IGlobes, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Beaufort, Bastien] Univ Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3, CREDA UMR7227, Paris, France; [Beaufort, Bastien] CNRS, Paris, France",,"Le Tourneau, FM (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, UMI IGlobes, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",fmlt@fmlt.net,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,11.0,1,,,,70,96,,10.18352/ijc.589,,,,,,,,WOS:000400043600002,

We use the tropical rainforests of the Amazon, the Congo basin and South-East Asia as a case study to investigate spatial predictive models of LULC change. Current predictions differ in their modelling approaches, are highly variable and often poorly validated. We carried out a quantitative review of 48 modelling methodologies, considering model spatio-temporal scales, inputs, calibration and validation methods. In addition, we requested model outputs from each of the models reviewed and carried out a quantitative assessment of model performance for tropical LULC predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We highlight existing shortfalls in the discipline and uncover three key points that need addressing to improve the transparency, reliability and utility of tropical LULC change models: (1) a lack of openness with regard to describing and making available the model inputs and model code; (2) the difficulties of conducting appropriate model validations; and (3) the difficulty that users of tropical LULC models face in obtaining the model predictions to help inform their own analyses and policy decisions. We further draw comparisons between tropical LULC change models in the tropics and the modelling approaches and paradigms in other disciplines, and suggest that recent changes in the climate change and species distribution modelling communities may provide a pathway that tropical LULC change modellers may emulate to further improve the discipline. Climate change models have exerted considerable influence over public perceptions of climate change and now impact policy decisions at all political levels. We suggest that tropical LULC change models have an equally high potential to influence public opinion and impact the development of land-use policies based on plausible future scenarios, but, to do that reliably may require further improvements in the discipline.","[Rosa, Isabel M.

We evaluate opportunities and challenges facing the development of a more interactive research environment by developing an interdisciplinary synthesis of research on a single geographic region. We focus on the Amazon as it is of enormous regional and global environmental importance and faces a highly uncertain future. To take stock of existing knowledge and provide a framework for analysis we present a set of mini-reviews from fourteen different areas of research, encompassing taxonomy, biodiversity, biogeography, vegetation dynamics, landscape ecology, earth-atmosphere interactions, ecosystem processes, fire, deforestation dynamics, hydrology, hunting, conservation planning, livelihoods, and payments for ecosystem services. Each review highlights the current state of knowledge and identifies research priorities, including major challenges and opportunities. We show that while substantial progress is being made across many areas of scientific research, our understanding of specific issues is often dependent on knowledge from other disciplines. Accelerating the acquisition of reliable and contextualized knowledge about the fate of complex pristine and modified ecosystems is partly dependent on our ability to exploit economies of scale in shared resources and technical expertise, recognise and make explicit interconnections and feedbacks among sub-disciplines, increase the temporal and spatial scale of existing studies, and improve the dissemination of scientific findings to policy makers and society at large. Enhancing interaction among research efforts is vital if we are to make the most of limited funds and overcome the challenges posed by addressing large-scale interdisciplinary questions. Bringing together a diverse scientific community with a single geographic focus can help increase awareness of research questions both within and among disciplines, and reveal the opportunities that may exist for advancing acquisition of reliable knowledge. This approach could be useful for a variety of globally important scientific questions.","[Barlow, Jos; Parry, Luke] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Ewers, Robert M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Anderson, Liana; Malhi, Yadvinder; Roman-Cuesta, Rosa Maria] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Aragao, Luiz E.

It alters the tropical habitat environments and results in release of carbons as wen. The traditional way of logging is through forest clearing, which converts forest to other land uses such as agriculture or rangeland. Recently a new form of forest degradation is selective logging, removing only those good quality tree species. This form of deforestation does not result in land use conversion, but degradation. Logging by means of clear-cutting can be easily detected and monitored from satellite images such as those from Landsat sensors. However, detection and monitoring selective logging is difficult with satellite images because the process only removes a small number of trees per area, resulting in subtle disturbances but substantial removal of biomass. Therefore, traditional classification technique is unable to detect and monitor this type of disturbances effectively. In order to detect selective logging, and to better understand carbon sequestrations, a continuous field ought to be used that can quantify the degree of disturbances due to selective logging, instead of using binary classification techniques. In this paper, we used signal-unmixing techniques in a spectral vegetation index domain as a continuous field measure of forest density, with which selective logging is mapped and quantified. The spectral index used is the MSAVI further modified to enhance its sensitivity to subtle forest degradations in the tropical environments in Brazilian Amazon as well as in Southeast Asia. The approach is validated with high-resolution IKONOS images and field observations and proves to be more efficient in detecting selective logging.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, BSRSI, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Qi, JG (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, BSRSI, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2002.0,,,,,,2078,2080,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000179116800677,

Here we assess those thresholds and characteristics within the context of selective logging in the Bolivian Amazon. Our study combined field measurements of the spatial and temporal dynamics of felling gaps and skid trails ranging from < I to 19 months following reduced-impact logging in a forest in lowland Bolivia with remote-sensing measurements from simultaneous monthly ASTER satellite overpasses. A probabilistic spectral mixture model (AutoMCU) was used to derive per-pixel fractional cover estimates of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil. Results were compared with the normalized difference in vegetation index (NDVI). The forest studied had considerably lower basal area and harvest volumes than logged sites in the Brazilian Amazon where similar remote-sensing analyses have been performed. Nonetheless, individual felling-gap area was positively correlated with canopy openness, percentage liana coverage, rates of vegetation regrowth, and height of remnant NPV. Both liana growth and NPV occurred primarily in the crown zone of the felling gap, whereas exposed soil was limited to the trunk zone of the gap. In felling gaps > 400 m(2), NDVI, and the PV and NPV fractions, were distinguishable from unlogged forest values for up to six months after logging; felling gaps < 400 m(2) were distinguishable for up to three months after harvest, but we were entirely unable to distinguish skid trails from our analysis of the spectral data.","Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Carnegie Inst, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Inst Boliviano Invest Forestal, Santa Cruz, Bolivia",,"Zarin, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",djzarin@mail.ifas.ufl.edu,,,,,,,28,29,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2006.0,16.0,3,,,,1148,1163,,10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[1148:ROFSAS]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,WOS:000238451500026,

Deforestation is a complex process with many potential feedback loops, many of which are ignored in models that attempt to interpolate forest loss based on past deforestation rates. In addition, most ecological studies of the impacts of deforestation have focused on landscapes that are already fragmented. These studies ignore the fact that edge effects, such as anthropogenic fire, reach their maximum well before habitat connectivity is lost and may create positive feedbacks that result in further fragmentation. We developed a simple model to explore the potential influence of edge effects on fragmentation rates and used remotely sensed data from the MAP (Madre de Dios, Acre, and Pando) region of the Brazilian Amazon to parameterize the relationships of interest. Under reasonable real-world parameter combinations, edge effects can have a significant impact on deforestation rates, supporting the hypothesis that the true tipping point in a forest to pasture regime shift occurs earlier (i.e., similar to 50% forest loss) than analysis of a loss in connectivity would suggest (i.e., similar to 60% forest loss).

A whole gradient exists for these forests, spanning from well conserved to severely degraded. For decision makers, there is an urgent need to better characterize the status of the forest resource at the regional scale. Until now, few studies have been carried out on the potential of multisource, freely accessible remote sensing for modelling and mapping degraded forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass (AGB). The aim of this article is to address that gap and to evaluate the potential of optical (Landsat, MODIS) and radar (ALOS-1 PALSAR, Sentinel-1) remote sensing sources in modelling and mapping forest AGB in the old pioneer front of Paragominas municipality (Para state). We derived a wide range of vegetation and textural indices and combined them with in situ collected AGB data into a random forest regression model to predict AGB at a resolution of 20 m. The model explained 28% of the variance with a root mean square error of 97.1 Mgha(-1) and captured all spatial variability. We identified Landsat spectral unmixing and mid-infrared indicators to be the most robust indicators with the highest explanatory power. AGB mapping reveals that 87% of forest is degraded, with illegal logging activities, impacted forest edges and other spatial distribution of AGB that are not captured with pantropical datasets. We validated this map with a field-based forest degradation typology built on canopy height and structure observations. We conclude that the modelling framework developed here combined with high-resolution vegetation status indicators can help improve the management of degraded forests at the regional scale.","[Bourgoin, Clement; Blanc, Lilian; Cornu, Guillaume; Sist, Plinio; Gond, Valery] CIRAD, Forets & Soc, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Bourgoin, Clement; Blanc, Lilian; Cornu, Guillaume; Sist, Plinio; Gond, Valery] Univ Montpellier, Forets & Soc, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Bailly, Jean-Stephane] Univ Montpellier, LISAH, INRA, IRD,Montpellier SupAgro, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Bailly, Jean-Stephane] Dept SIAFEE AgroParisTech, F-75231 Paris, France; [Berenguer, Erika] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Berenguer, Erika] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Oszwald, Johan] Univ Rennes 2, UMR CNRS LETG 6554, Lab Geog & Remote Sensing COSTEL, F-35043 Rennes, France; [Tritsch, Isabelle] Univ Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3, Ctr Rech & Documentat Amer CREDA, UMR 7227, F-75006 Paris, France; [Laurent, Francois; Hasan, Ali F.] Le Mans Univ, UMR CNRS ESO Espaces & Soc, F-72000 Le Mans, France",,"Bourgoin, C (corresponding author), CIRAD, Forets & Soc, F-34398 Montpellier, France.; Bourgoin, C (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Forets & Soc, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",clement.bourgoin@cirad.fr; lilian.blanc@cirad.fr; bailly@agroparistech.fr; guillaume.cornu@cirad.fr; erikaberenguer@gmail.com; johan.oszwald@univ-rennes2.fr; isabelle.tritsch@gmail.com; francois.laurent@univ-lemans.fr; alihassanali78@yahoo.com; plinio.sist@cirad.fr; valery.gond@cirad.fr,,,,,,,19,20,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2018.0,9.0,6,,,,,,303,10.3390/f9060303,,,,,,,,WOS:000436277900020,

This reduction has been achieved despite high beef and soy prices, which in previous years had pushed deforestation upward, and during the same time that Brazil made important social progress in reducing poverty, hunger and inequality. The reduction in global warming pollution that this represents is the largest contribution so far by any country, rich or poor. Several factors are responsible for this accomplishment. They include: government policies and enforcement actions by prosecutors, on both the federal and state levels; the incentive created by Norway's pledge of up to $1 billion in results-based compensation through the Amazon Fund; the strong and concerted pressure exerted by Brazilian civil society on the government and the soy and beef industries; and the positive response by those industries, resulting in the 2006 soy and 2009 beef moratoria. Political leaders, such as President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and especially Minister of the Environment/2010 Green Party presidential candidate Marina Silva, can also claim an important share of the credit.

Interannual climate variability and frequent disturbances both favor grasses over trees, causing large increases in the geographic extent of savanna in the south and east of the region. A more constant climate and less frequent disturbances both favor trees over grasses, causing forest to dominate most of the study area. While climate variability and disturbances have a major impact on ecosystem structure, we find that compensating processes between herbaceous and woody plants damp the simulated response of carbon and water fluxes.

Two frog species were sampled from each of the two main forest habitats on both banks of the Jurua River in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon Basin at various points along its course to contrast different barrier strengths. Scarthyla ostinodactyla and Scinax rubra were sampled from flooded forest (varzea), and Physalaemus petersi and Epipedobates femoralis from non-flooded forest (terra firme). All species showed high levels of within-population genetic variation. Average Nei's (1978) and Rogers' (1972) genetic distances between sampled sites for all species were high indicating substantial among-population differentiation. The observation of low gene flow between sampled sires within species was further substantiated with Slatkin's (1993) M analyses. Randomization tests suggested that there was some population structure at a few assayed polymorphic loci that was consistent with the riverine barrier hypothesis. However, it was apparent from the raw allozyme frequency data that these results were largely driven by substantial differentiation al one or a few collecting localities rather than by basin-wide patterns of riverine differentiation. Phenograms using genetic distance matrices supported this interpretation. Patterns of geographic variation are probably more consistent with the idea of this region being a zone of secondary contact.","Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",,"Gascon, C (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonica, Biol Dynam Forest Fragments Project, CP 478, BR-69011970 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",,,,,,,,89,93,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,1998.0,30.0,1,,,,104,119,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.1998.tb00373.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000072972300010,

Within the framework of the MEC, the authors conduct a normative analysis - based on the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) - of the state duties and corporate responsibilities for adverse human rights impacts in the complex. The authors use a single, in-depth case study approach, focussing on the case of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazonian state of Para. The MEC proves to be a useful framework for studying the advancement of hydroelectricity and mining projects on the Amazonian frontier. The analysis indicates that the Brazilian minerals and energy sectors are mutually dependent and have overlapping interests and decision-making structures. Applying the MEC framework to the Belo Monte case serves to clarify and detangle the relationships between the various actors associated with the dart's adverse impacts. This provides a foundation for the normative analysis of the responsibilities and actions required of each actor based on the internationally-accepted standards in the UNGPs. By applying the MEC as an analytical research framework and drawing on the UNGPs for normative guidance, the present study contributes to the academic literature on corporate responsibility, as well as providing policy and decision-makers with a normative-empirical analysis that can be drawn upon to improve policy and ensure that corporate activity contributes to sustainable development.

Between 1973 and 1993, the national government continued to improve highway BR364 connecting the area to Brazil's south-central region and established a colony in Theobroma. During this period, 98% of the deforestation occurred. Some 1800 settler families continue to convert forest into pasture in a system based on the slash-and-burn agriculture and dual-purpose cattle production. Trends in carbon emissions and plant species losses during the 20-year history of Theobroma were analyzed by combining observed shifts in land-use types with estimates for the carbon stocks and plant species richness of each of these types. Carbon stocks declined from about 200 t ha(-1) in the forest to 28 t ha(-1) in the pasture and of 326 plant species encountered in the forest, only 20 remained in pastures (along with 66 species not found in forests). The effects of converting more than 93000 ha of forest into other uses over 20 years include approximate losses of 14 million tons of C to the atmosphere and substantial losses of plant species. Land use alternatives that would store more C include agroforestry and - given the strong incentives for settlers to convert lands into pasture - improving pasture management or developing silvopastoral systems. Plant species conservation may be improved with proposed ways to add private value to the forest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Specifically, we concentrate on two territories controlled by Jivaroan indigenous groups. First, the analysis compares the structural characteristics of riverine and interfluvial cultivation systems in the region. Second, the study investigates the connections between agricultural intensity, population pressure and composition, and terrain conditions at the household level through the integration of geographic information systems, remote sensing, socio-economic surveys, and regression analyses. The study shows that although cultivation practices and the proportion between consumers and producers at the household level are not significantly different among riverine and interfluvial groups, riverine cultivators produce more intensively than interfluvial landholders. In general, the demand for agricultural production at a household level is positively correlated with population pressure and soil quality. In this region, the extent of cultivation is significantly associated with the proportion between consumers and producers along the household's developmental cycle. These findings provide support for the view that land use intensification among indigenous peoples is similar to the dynamic among non-indigenous market-oriented producers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

CPs are primarily interpreted as stages of the annual cycle of the low-level circulation. We identified three winter'' CPs (CP7, CP8, and CP9), three summer'' CPs (CP3, CP4, and CP5), and three transitional'' CPs (CP1, CP2, and CP6). Significant long-term changes are detected during the dry-to-wet transition season (July-October) over southern tropical South America (STSA). One of the wintertime patterns (CP9) increases from 20% in the 1980s to 35% in the last decade while the transitional'' CP2 decreases from 13% to 7%. CP9 is characterized by enhancement of the South American low-level jet and increasing atmospheric subsidence over STSA. CP2 is characterized by southerly cold-air incursions and anomalous convective activity over STSA. The years characterized by high frequency of CP9 and low frequency of CP2 during the dry-to-wet transition season are associated with a delayed South American monsoon onset and anomalous dry conditions over STSA. Consistently, a higher frequency of CP9 intensifies the fire season over STSA (1999-2020). Over the Brazilian states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Goias, and Sao Paulo, the seasonal frequency of CP9 explains around 35%-44% of the interannual variations of fire counts.","[Espinoza, Jhan-Carlo; Junquas, Clementine; Segura, Hans; Sierra-Perez, Juan Pablo; Wongchuig, Sly; Condom, Thomas] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IRD, CNRS, Inst Geosci Environm, Grenoble, France; [Arias, Paola A.] Univ Antioquia, Fac Ingn, Grp Ingn & Gest Ambiental, Medellin, Colombia; [Moron, Vincent] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, INRAE,Coll France CEREGE, Aix En Provence, France; [Moron, Vincent] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY USA",,"Espinoza, JC (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, IRD, CNRS, Inst Geosci Environm, Grenoble, France.",jhan-carlo.espinoza@ird.fr,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021.0,34.0,22,,,,9025,9042,,10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0303.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000752646200013,

The Brazilian Amazon currently releases about 0.2 Pg-C to the atmosphere each year as a result of net deforestation. Logging and forest fire activity are poorly quantified but certainly increase this amount by more than 10%. Fires associated with land management activities generate smoke that leads to heating of the lower atmosphere, decreases in overall cloudiness, increases in cloud lifetimes, and the suppression of rainfall. There are considerable uncertainties associated with our understanding of smoke effects. Present development trends point to agricultural intensification in the Brazilian Amazon.

We analyzed the spatial progression of fire fronts and the temporal changes in the extent of burning at the scales of the pixel sizes of MODIS (I km) and GOES Imager (4 km). The progression of fire fronts varied between individual fires, but in most cases remained within the scale of a few 30-m pixels, while the total extent of burning detected typically increased during the 30 min between the ETM+ and ASTER observations. This is in accordance with the typical mid-morning upslope part of the diurnal cycle of fire activity observed previously by coarse resolution sensors. We also assessed the potential changes in derived validation results of active fire products from medium and coarse resolution sensors. We derived fire detection probabilities from Terra/MODIS as a function of the total number of 30-m fire pixels from ASTER (representing simultaneous reference data and, hence, the truth) and separately from ETM+ (representing nonsimultaneous reference data). We found spuriously increased detection probabilities using ETM+ resulting from the observed increase of fire activity between the ETM+ and ASTER acquisitions. While this effect can potentially be corrected for by a statistical adjustment, the overall recommendation is that a temporally unbiased sample of nonsimultaneous reference data should be used for validation.","[Csiszar, Ivan A.] NESDIS, NOAA, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA; [Schroeder, Wilfrid] Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",,"Csiszar, IA (corresponding author), NESDIS, NOAA, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA.",ivan.csiszar@noaa.gov; wilfrid.schroeder@noaa.gov,,,,,,,15,16,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2008.0,1.0,4,,,,248,253,,10.1109/JSTARS.2008.2011377,,,,,,,,WOS:000265492500005,

Increases in anthropogenic N have had multiple effects on the atmosphere, on terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, and even on human health. Unfortunately, methodological limitations challenge our ability to directly measure natural N inputs via biological N fixation (BNF)-the largest natural source of new N to ecosystems. This confounds efforts to quantify the extent of anthropogenic perturbation to the N cycle. To address this gap, we used a pair of indirect methods-analytical modeling and N balance-to generate independent estimates of BNF in a presumed hotspot of N fixation, a tropical rain forest site in central Rondnia in the Brazilian Amazon Basin. Our objectives were to attempt to constrain symbiotic N fixation rates in this site using indirect methods, and to assess strengths and weaknesses of this approach by looking for areas of convergence and disagreement between the estimates. This approach yielded two remarkably similar estimates of N fixation. However, when compared to a previously published bottom-up estimate, our analysis indicated much lower N inputs via symbiotic BNF in the Rondnia site than has been suggested for the tropics as a whole. This discrepancy may reflect errors associated with extrapolating bottom-up fluxes from plot-scale measures, those resulting from the indirect analyses, and/or the relatively low abundance of legumes at the Rondnia site. While indirect methods have some limitations, we suggest that until the technological challenges of directly measuring N fixation are overcome, integrated approaches that employ a combination of model-generated and empirically-derived data offer a promising way of constraining N inputs via BNF in natural ecosystems.","[Cleveland, Cory C.; Reed, Sasha C.] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Houlton, Benjamin Z.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, MT 59812 USA; [Neill, Christopher] Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Reed, Sasha C.] US Geol Survey, SW Biol Sci Ctr, Moab, UT 84532 USA; [Townsend, Alan R.] Univ Colorado, Earth & Environm Sci Inst, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Townsend, Alan R.] Univ Colorado, Earth & Environm Sci Inst, INSTAAR, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Wang, Yingping] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia",,"Cleveland, CC (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, 32 Campus Dr,CHCB 423B, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",cory.cleveland@umontana.edu,,,,,,,32,32,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2010.0,99.0,1-3,,,,1,13,,10.1007/s10533-009-9392-y,,,,,,,,WOS:000279025100001,

Currently, most TP research focuses on the Brazilian part of the Amazon basin, but only little information is available on TP soils in the Colombian Amazon. Here, we sampled four TP and surrounding soils in the Colombian Amazon region at different soil depths and analyzed them for (i) general soil properties such as color, pH and texture, (ii) soil organic carbon and black carbon (BC) contents, the latter using benzene polycarboxylic acids as molecular marker, (iii) phosphorus availability based on sequential fractionation, and (iv) microbial residue contents using amino sugars. Our data from Colombia's middle Caqueta River and Leticia confirmed that SOC, BC, and total P were present in significantly higher concentrations in the TP areas than the surrounding soils, while pH values and microbial residue contents were unchanged. The enrichment of P forms comprised both easily extractable and stable P pools, which both dominated to a different degree, both in TP and adjacent soils. The different degree of SOC, BC and P enrichment suggests different amounts of waste disposal by the ancient populations at different TP sites, now warranting further research for reconstructing ancient population sizes from TP chemical analyses.","[Orozco-Ortiz, Juan Manuel; Bauke, Sara Louise; Moerchen, Ramona; Amelung, Wulf] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Soil Sci & Soil Ecol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Orozco-Ortiz, Juan Manuel; Borgemeister, Christian] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Pena-Venegas, Clara Patricia] Inst Amazon Invest Cient SINCHI, Leticia 910001, Colombia; [Lehndorff, Eva] Bayreuth Univ, Soil Ecol, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany",,"Orozco-Ortiz, JM (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Soil Sci & Soil Ecol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.; Orozco-Ortiz, JM (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",orozco.ortiz.juan@gmail.com; cpena@sinchi.org.co; sarabauke@uni-bonn.de; cb@uni-bonn.de; ramona.moerchen@uni-bonn.de; eva.lehndorff@uni-bayreuth.de; wulf.amelung@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2021.0,13.0,13,,,,,,7088,10.3390/su13137088,,,,,,,,WOS:000671017900001,

In this context, land cover maps of remote sensing data are the most commonly used EO products and development of adequate classification strategies is an ongoing research topic. However, the availability of meaningful multispectral data sets can be limited due to cloud cover, particularly in the tropics. In such regions, the use of SAR systems (Synthetic Aperture Radar), which are nearly independent form weather conditions, is particularly promising. With an ever-growing number of SAR satellites, as well as the increasing accessibility of SAR data, potentials for multi-frequency remote sensing are becoming numerous. In our study, we evaluate the synergistic contribution of multitemporal L-, C-, and X-band data to tropical land cover mapping. We compare classification outcomes of ALOS-2, RADARSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X datasets for a study site in the Brazilian Amazon using a wrapper approach. After preprocessing and calculation of GLCM texture (Grey Level Co-Occurence), the wrapper utilizes Random Forest classifications to estimate scene importance. Comparing the contribution of different wavelengths, ALOS-2 data perform best in terms of overall classification accuracy, while the classification of TerraSAR-X data yields higher accuracies when compared to the results achieved by RADARSAT-2. Moreover, the wrapper underlines potentials of multi-frequency classification as integration of multi-frequency images is always preferred over multi-temporal, mono-frequent composites. We conclude that, despite distinct advantages of certain sensors, for land cover classification, multi-sensoral integration is beneficial.","[Hagensieker, Ron; Waske, Bjoern] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geog Sci, Malteserstr 74-100, D-12249 Berlin, Germany",,"Hagensieker, R (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geog Sci, Malteserstr 74-100, D-12249 Berlin, Germany.",ron.hagensieker@fu-berlin.de; bjoern.waske@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2018.0,10.0,2,,,,,,257,10.3390/rs10020257,,,,,,,,WOS:000427542100101,

All hair samples exceeded the 1.0 mu g/g threshold set by the USEPA, whereas 93% of the volunteers had T-Hg blood levels greater than 5 mu g/L, suggesting elevated exposure. The mean Cd level was 3.1 mu g/L, with 21% of samples surpassing 5 mu g/L, value at which mitigating actions should be taken. Eighty-four percent of participants presented Se deficiencies (<100 mu g/L). There was a significant association between fish consumption and T-Hg in hair (rho = 0.323;p = 0.032) and blood (rho = 0.381;p = 0.011).

Most estimated migration rates in both species overlapped with zero, suggesting no measurable migration between most of the sampling locations. However, for S. guianensis, there was measurable migration in neighboring sampling locations.

Participants 210 patients with incoagulable blood were recruited from 221 consecutive patients, admitted with snake bite between January 1997 and December 2001. Intervention One of three antivenoms manufactured in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, chosen for their preclinical potency against Ecuadorian venoms. Main outcome measures Permanent restoration of blood coagulability after 6 and 24 hours. Results The snakes responsible for the bites were identified in 187 cases: 109 patients (58%) were bitten by Bothrops atrox, 68 (36%) by B bilineatus, and 10 (5%) by B taeniatus, B brazili, or Lachesis muta. Eighty seven patients (41%) received Colombian antivenom, 82 (39%) received Brazilian antivenom, but only 41 (20%) received Ecuadorian antivenom because the supply was exhausted. Two patients died; and 10 developed local necrosis. All antivenoms achieved the primary end point of permanently restoring blood coagulability by 6 or 24 hours after the start of treatment in >40% of patients. Colombian antivenom, however, was the most effective after initial doses of 20 ml (two vials), < 70 ml, and any initial dose at both 6 and 24 hours. An initial dose of 20 ml of Colombian antivenom permanently restored blood coagulability in 64% (46/72) of patients after 6 hours (P = 0.054 compared with the other two antivenoms) and an initial dose of < 70 ml was effective at 6 hours (65%, P = 0.045) and 24 hours (99%, P = 0.06). Early anaphylactoid reactions were common (53%,73%, and 19%, respectively, for Brazilian, Colombian, and Ecuadorian antivenoms, P < 0.0001) but only three reactions were severe and none was fatal. Conclusions All three antivenoms can be recommended for the treatment of snakebites in this region, though the reactogenicity of Brazilian and Colombian antivenoms is a cause for concern.","Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; Hosp Vozandes Oriente, Shell, Pastaza, Ecuador; Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Alistair Reid Venom Res Unit, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; Minist Hlth, Guayaquil, Ecuador; Fdn Herpetol Gustavo Orces, Quito, Ecuador",,"Warrell, DA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Oxford OX3 9DU, England.",david.warrell@clinical-medicine.oxford.ac.uk,,,,,,,77,79,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 13,2004.0,329.0,7475,,,,1129,1133,,10.1136/bmj.329.7475.1129,,,,,,,,WOS:000225169600016,

Two dominant hypotheses explain this process. First, according to the hamburger connection beef markets promote conversion of forests into cattle ranches resulting in deforestation. Second, the land-as-wealth hypothesis explains deforestation as the result of land appreciation in forest frontiers. We tested these hypotheses using land use and socioeconomic data from northwestern Amazonia from 2000 to 2009. We also investigated two key control variables: coca cultivation and eradication, both of which have been proposed as important drivers of forest loss. We found high rate of conversion from forest to pasture, and unimpeded forest fragmentation. As predicted by the hamburger connection, pastures expanded as the cattle inventory grew. Beef demand did not drive pasture expansion, as ranching revenues declined and beef prices were roughly stable. Coca cultivation did not respond to the eradication campaign, and declined as the population became increasingly urbanized. We propose that investment on roads has enhanced the anticipated value of land. Cattle bolster land claims and can be used as financial collateral, so they have inherent value even without market exchange. Cattle can then increase despite stable beef prices and declining ranching revenues. To protect biodiversity, policy interventions that enhance the value of standing forests are needed to slow deforestation and fragmentation in these rapidly changing landscapes.

For an improved, spatially and temporally explicit estimation, a time series of remote-sensing results and a model of secondary forest area and age distribution was combined with a large-scale forest-growth model. The observed trend of biomass decline is continuous and defines a baseline that the avoidance of deforestation could be measured against. Based on scenario calculations, the emission reductions from slightly reduced deforestation rates could be valued in the range of El billion annually.

Our results evidence the existence of two geographically differentiated venom phenotypes. The venom from Colombia comprises at least 26 different proteins belonging to 9 different groups of toxins. PI-metalloproteinases and K49-PLA(2) molecules represent the most abundant toxins. On the other hand, the venoms from Brazilian, Ecuadorian, and Peruvian B. atrox contain predominantly PIII-metalloproteinases. These toxin profiles correlate with the venom phenotypes of adult and juvenile B. asper from Costa Rica, respectively, suggesting that paedomorphism represented a selective trend during the trans-Amazonian southward expansion of B. atrox through the Andean Corridor. The high degree of crossreactivity of a Costa Rican polyvalent (Bothrops asper, Lachesis stenophrys, Crotalus simus) antivenom against B. atrox venoms further evidenced the close evolutionary kinship between B. asper and B. atrox. This antivenom was more efficient immunodepleting proteins from the venoms of B. atrox from Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru than from Colombia. Such behaviour may be rationalized taking into account the lower content of poorly immunogenic toxins, such as PLA(2) molecules and PI-SVMPs in the paedomorphic venoms. The immunological profile of the Costa Rican antivenom strongly suggests the possibility of using this antivenom for the management of snakebites by B. atrox in Colombia and the Amazon regions of Ecuador, Peri and Brazil.

Environmental impact assessment (EIA) methods traditionally determine the counterfactual based on strong assumptions of stationarity (e.g., using before and after comparisons) and can be particularly challenging to use in the context of substantial data gaps, a vexing problem when combining several time-series data from different sources. Here we propose and test a widely applicable statistical approach for quantifying environmental impacts that avoids the stationarity assumption and circumvents issues associated with data gaps. Specifically, we used a Gaussian Copula (GC) model to assess the hydrological impacts of the Tucurui dam on the Tocantins River in the Brazilian Amazon. Using multi-source water level and climate data, GC predictions of pre-dam hydrology for the validation period were excellent (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.83 to 0.98 and 93-96% of observations within the 95% predictive intervals). In the post-dam period, the river had higher dry-season water levels both upstream and downstream relative to the predicted counterfactual, and the timing and duration of wet-season drawdown was delayed and extended, substantially altering the flood pulse. These impacts were evident as far as 176 km away from the dam, highlighting widespread hydrological impacts. The GC model outperformed standard multiple regression models in representing predictive uncertainty while also avoiding the stationarity assumption and circumventing the issue of sparse and incomplete data. We thus believe the GC approach has wide utility for integrating disparate time-series data to quantify the impacts of dams and other anthropogenic phenomena on riverine hydrology globally.

Drawing upon the example of an ethnodevelopment project based on guarana production by indigenous Satere-Mawe people in the Brazilian Amazon, two important issues are addressed. First, we reflect on how a traditional management system can contribute to both biological and cultural conservation, even when that system is inserted in new global markets and spoken about through a scientific perspective. Second, we address the challenge of incorporating ILK into conservation research by formulating a set of methodological proposals. We show that ILK is a dynamic, adaptive and political product of local-global interactions. This leads us to defend an analysis of ILK that would focus on its processes of creation rather than on the body of knowledge that results from them, thus helping to account for ILK's vitality and the various forms of its legitimation. At the crossroads of ethnobiology, science and technology studies, and social anthropology, these research methods seek to go beyond the inventory, categorization and structural analysis of thoughts and practices to instead privilege an analysis of the interactions between local populations and resources; at the same time, they operate across different scales and integrate actors from the beginning to the end of (sometimes long) value chains. Such an approach aims to make visible the modes of knowledge translation and hybridization that indigenous people might implement to maintain control over their collective identities and their relationship with a changing environment.

The exploration of market opportunities for the commercialization of forest goods and services has become the prevailing conservation approach. It is likely that the generation of income from forests will motivate forest owners and users to appreciate and use their resources more sustainably. After more than 20 years of applying, adjusting and expanding this approach, this paper critically reflects on its main assumptions, successes and consequences with a special emphasis on the Amazon's natural forests. Over time, three major strategies have been outlined to translate the approach into practice: (1) the management of timber by logging companies in forest concessions, (2) the use of timber and non-timber forest products by smallholders and communities, and (3) the selling of environmental services that forests provide, in particular carbon. The analysis revealed that the commercialization of goods and services from natural forests has indeed the potential to generate income, yet their financial attractiveness is rather limited if compared with other land use options. This seriously affects the probability that forest-related uses at a wider scale will be successful. It also became evident that the legal-institutional framework set up to facilitate economic gains from the forests' commercial potential tended to discriminate against traditional forest users who, due to disparate reasons, would be willing to accept the modest financial returns from managing natural forests in commercial ways. It is discussed that the feasibility of market approaches, in contrast to the assumptions of free market environmentalism, depends on effective measures to strengthen the role and market position of local forest users and on initiatives from firms to invest in the establishment of more sustainable commodities even when a reduction in profits are a possibility.

The government recently initiated a programme intended to regularize titles of 300,000 homesteaders in unassigned public land in the Amazon region. This effort in state making over a largely illegible landscape is aimed at offsetting large-scale illegal land grabs and ongoing (though significantly curtailed) deforestation. In contrast, legal large-scale agribusiness investments are exacerbating deforestation and the concentration of land ownership in the Cerrado region through well-established state mechanisms. While the imposition of legibility may regulate land concentration and degradation, legible landscapes also facilitate investments that drive both concentration and degradation. The author argues that the regularization programme undertaken in the Amazon structures land grabbing nationally not because large amounts of public land are in fact being privatized through regularization, but because it actively undermines land redistribution programmes elsewhere in the country and consolidates transportation and production infrastructure in the AmazonCerrado transition zone. The state-making framework developed here captures the heterogeneity of global land grab processes, indicating the ways in which these are obstructed but not discarded by different government agencies, stalled but not yet overturned by Brazilian civil society.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Oliveira, GDT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, 507 McCone Hall 4740, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",oliveira@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,53,54,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2013.0,44.0,2,,,,261,283,,10.1111/dech.12009,,,,,,,,WOS:000316327400004,

Family agriculture based on slash-and-burn enables millions of people to live in that region. However, the poor nutrient content of most Amazonian soils requires cation-rich ashes from the burning of the vegetation biomass for cultivation to be successful, which leads to forest ecosystem degradation, soil erosion and mercury contamination. While recent studies have suggested that mercury present in soils was transferred towards rivers upon deforestation, little is known about the dynamics between agricultural land-use and mercury leaching. In this context, the present study proposes an explanation that illustrates how agricultural land-use triggers mercury loss from soils. This explanation lies in the competition between base cations and mercury in soils which are characterized by a low adsorption capacity. Since these soils are naturally very poor in base cations, the burning of the forest biomass suddenly brings high quantities of base cations to soils, destabilizing the previous equilibrium amongst cations. Base cation enrichment triggers mobility in soil cations, rapidly dislocating mercury atoms. This conclusion comes from principal component analyses illustrating that agricultural land-use was associated with base cation enrichment and mercury depletion. The overall conclusions highlight a pernicious cycle: while soil nutrient enrichment actually occurs through biomass burning, although on a temporary basis, there is a loss in Hg content, which is leached to rivers, entering the aquatic chain, and posing a potential health threat to local populations. Data presented here reflects three decades of deforestation activities, but little is known about the long-term impact of such a disequilibrium. These findings may have repercussions on our understanding of the complex dynamics of deforestation and agriculture worldwide. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The oleoresin extracted from Copaifera trees is an economically important non-timber forest product harvested throughout the lowland Amazon basin. We studied oleoresin extraction from four species of Copaifera trees with known harvest histories within two contiguous extractive reserves in western Brazilian Amazonia. We conducted a large-scale experimental harvest of 179 previously unharvested Copaifera trees, in both seasonally flooded (varzea) and adjacent unflooded (terra firme) forests. The likelihood of trees yielding any oleoresin was principally determined by their species identity: C. multijuga was the only species to regularly yield oleoresin (70% of trees). Yield volumes varied both amongst species and forest types: C. multijuga (restricted to terra firme forest) had the highest mean yield of 505 ml, whilst C guyanensis produced higher volumes of oleoresin in varzea (139 ml) than terra firme (15 ml) forest. Intraspecific differences were driven mainly by tree size. To assess extraction sustainability, we reharvested a sample of C. multijuga trees and compared the oleoresin production of 24 conspecific trees that had been initially harvested one year previously with that of 17 trees initially harvested three years previously. Reharvested trees produced just 35% of the oleoresin volume compared to that when originally drilled, but this response was not affected by the time interval between consecutive harvests. We demonstrate that, within a population of Copaifera, both morphological and environmental factors restrict total productivity; consideration of these factors should inform sustainable management practises. We additionally raise methodological considerations that may improve the comparability of studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Yet regional climate models often do not include accurate land cover data of these complex landscapes. We use National Center for Atmospheric Research's Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model to run 10-year climate simulations across Brazil to assess (1) whether an accurate, regionally validated land cover data set with two, new agricultural land cover classifications improves model simulation results; (2) the ability of Noah-MP's dynamic vegetation option to model vegetation growth; and (3) the sensitivity of the model output to scale. The results of the simulations with the updated land surface perform better over intensive agricultural areas for precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature, especially during the wet-to-dry season transition months. Evapotranspiration is overestimated during the start of the rainy season across all model simulations, which is likely due to the soil moisture model. We also find that using the Noah-MP dynamic vegetation significantly degrades agricultural leaf area index phenology simulations in Brazilian agricultural regions. Lastly, improving the model's resolution did not improve model output when compared to observational data. Incorporating more accurate representations of the landscape into regional climate models is essential for quantifying potential changes in climatological seasonality in dynamic, human-modified regions and making informed land use decisions. Plain Language Summary Humans are the largest drive of landscape change globally. One region that exemplifies this change is Brazil's Cerradoover half of it has been cleared for agriculture. Farmers in the region depend on a stable rainy season to cultivate crops like soy and corn, but, clearing Cerrado for agriculture may disturb regional climate and affect precipitation. The first step to assessing these impacts is determining whether a more accurate land surface improves simulation results and where the model still needs to be improved. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to run 10-year-long climate simulations across Brazil with both the default U.S. Geological Survey land cover map and an updated land cover map with two new agricultural categories. Our results show that using an updated map improves model results over regions of intensive agriculture, especially in the dry-to-wet-season transition months. All simulation results show an overestimation in evapotranspiration rates and a cold bias during the rainy season. These biases seem to be the result of WRF's soil-moisture model. Understanding both these interactions and how we can use climate models to better study them is essential for making informed land use decisions.","[Spera, Stephanie A.] Dartmouth Coll, Neukom Inst Computat Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Spera, Stephanie A.; Winter, Jonathan M.; Chipman, Jonathan W.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",,"Spera, SA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Neukom Inst Computat Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.; Spera, SA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",stephanie.a.spera@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 27,2018.0,123.0,10,,,,5163,5176,,10.1029/2017JD027989,,,,,,,,WOS:000435445600023,

Any sustainable land management strategy should, therefore, include a consideration of long-term effects on SOC. In the future, we have the opportunity to adopt land management strategies that lead to greater C storage in the soil. However, to do so, we need consistent estimates of SOC stocks and changes under varying land use and climate change scenarios. A Global Environment Facility (GEF) project developed a generically applicable system (the GEFSOC Modelling System) for making such estimates. The system links two dynamic SOC models, designed for site scale applications (Century and RothC) and an empirical method, to spatial databases, giving spatially explicit results that allow geographic areas of change in SOC stocks to be identified. The system was developed using data from four contrasting eco-regions (The Brazilian Amazon, Jordan, Kenya and the Indian part of the Indo-Gangetic Plains). These areas were chosen, as they are located in regions previously underrepresented by soil C models. The system was then used to estimates SOC stocks and changes between 1990 and 2030 under likely land use change scenarios in each of the four regions. Losses in SOC of between 5 and 16 % were projected for each of the four areas over a 30-year period (2000-2030), driven by a range of factors including deforestation, overgrazing and conversion of grazing land to agriculture.

Studies examining the effect of this land conversion on biodiversity have tended to focus predominantly on Southeast Asia, where the majority of the world's oil palm is produced. Because the Amazon possesses the greatest area of suitable land for oil palm expansion, oil palm is considered an emerging threat to Amazonian biodiversity. This is the first study to examine how oil palm agriculture affects avian diversity within the context ofWestern Amazonia. We used mist nets to conduct avifaunal surveys of forest and oil palm habitat in the Pucallpa region of Peruvian Amazonia. Bird species richness, species evenness, and overall abundance were all significantly higher in the forest than in oil palm habitat. Strikingly, less than 5% of all captured species were common to both forest and oil palm habitat. The species absent from the oil palm plantations were disproportionately habitat specialists, forest interior birds, birds with high sensitivity to disturbance, and insectivores and frugivores. The results suggest that oil palm is particularly poor habitat for Amazonian birds, and that the species that are persist on them are of lower conservation value. Given the apparent lack of diversity on oil palm plantations, preventing further conversion of forests to oil palm should be prioritized. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The copulation lasted at least 142 minutes, and was characterized by the male biting the hind neck and back of the female, constant female vocalizations, and rapid head turning by the female toward the male. Olingos and kinkajous were similarly abundant. These observations offer insight into the behavior of the wild olingo.","[Williams, Sean M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Williams, SM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",seanbirder@gmail.com,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,33.0,3,,,,,,e20160027,10.1590/S1984-4689zool-20160027,,,,,,,,WOS:000380851100010,

Half of the stands were forest regrowth following clearance and only 1 y of cultivation; the other half were regrowth following 4 y or more of continuous pasture in Brazil and three or more rotations of medium-fallow agriculture in Bolivia. Above-ground live biomass was estimated using published allometric equations. Total biomass ranged from 17 to 207 Mg ha(-1). Biomass of pioneer trees was poorly related to stand age, while that of later-successional trees increased linearly with age. Total biomass accumulation in Bolivia averaged 5.4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) over the entire age sequence. Biomass accumulation for regrowth following short-term use was not greater than that for regrowth following medium-fallow agriculture. In Brazil, biomass accumulation averaged 9.1 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) over the first 12 y of regrowth and 5.9 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) over the entire age sequence.

A case study in the Amazon,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Rainforests ensure fundamental water-related ecosystem services that are currently threatened by land-use change, in particular deforestation. Quantitative assessments of water-related ecosystem services have traditionally focused on the benefits linked to direct water availability for humans. Under this perspective, forests have been considered as water consumers, due to high interception and transpiration rates that reduce water flows available to downstream human activities. In contrast, their role as water suppliers through transpiration from tree canopies has often been neglected. Integrating this second perspective into assessments of water-related ecosystem services from forests and other land covers is key to providing a comprehensive support to decision-making processes on land-use change. In addition, specific indicators are necessary to incorporate the contribution of the different water balance components into ecosystem service assessment. In this paper, we investigate the use of water balance partitioning for the assessment of water-related ecosystem services. We use three water balance models (two existing ones and one developed in this study) and compare, via model simulations, water balance partitioning and water-related ecosystem services of a forested and a deforested area of the Brazilian State of Rondonia. Then, we propose a set of indicators that, based on the outputs of the models, provide a multidimensional characterization of different land-use types. Regardless of the model used, the values of these indicators for the selected case study consistently point out the key role of vegetation in regulating the water cycle. Forests act as effective indirect water suppliers for human activities and are key players in moisture recycling, thanks to high evapotranspiration rates (about 68% of total precipitation). Deforested areas, instead, act as direct suppliers of water flows for human activities due to higher drainage rates (about 50% of total precipitation). The proposed methodology helps highlight the importance of comprehensive water-related ecosystem services assessments. Moreover, the indicators quantitatively support the impact assessment of land-use change on the different processes involved in the water cycle and on human activities relying, directly or indirectly, on these processes.","[Casagrande, Enrico; Recanati, Francesca; Melia, Paco] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, Via Ponzio 34-5, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Casagrande, Enrico; Bevacqua, Daniele] INRAE, UR1115 PSH, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Rulli, Maria Cristina] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Ingn Idraul Ambientale Infrastruttur, Ambientale, Piazza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",,"Melia, P (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, Via Ponzio 34-5, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",paco.melia@polimi.it,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021.0,121.0,,,,,,,107155,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107155,,,,,,,,WOS:000604861300002,

We show how changes in beef production and consumption in Russia following the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991 contributed to the emergence of a beef trade linkage between Brazil and Russia. We argue that the decline of Russian beef production after 1991, the rebound of domestic consumption since the late 1990s, the global beef trade constellation of the early 2000s, and the booming Brazilian cattle sector during the same periods forged a strong and lasting telecoupling in the beef trade between Brazil and Russia. As a result, Russia became the largest importer of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions embodied in Brazilian beef exports since the 2000s. Our review exemplifies how the combination of institutional and socioeconomic shocks along with major changes in global markets can couple food systems and redistribute environmental footprints across long distances. Incorporating telecouplings in assessments of sustainable food systems is therefore important. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The solutions to these challenges required riverine leaders to not only build extensive social networks, but also forced them to create mutually reinforcing configurations of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital. A position generator survey conducted among a sample of riverine communities in the municipality of Labrea, Amazonas confirmed that riverine leaders had more extensive linking social capital than non-leaders. Two years of ethnographic research identified the complex micro-sociological processes riverine leaders engaged in to create the configurations of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital required to achieve collective goals. These micro-sociological processes included day-to-day behaviors, actions, interactions, and complex decisions regarding how and when to activate and deactivate relationships. This research indicates that analyzing day-to-day micro-sociological processes is useful not only to understand social capital configurations, but also to understand how some people are able to create more social capital than others. However, while some micro-sociological processes facilitate social capital configurations, others complicate efforts to create and maintain them. This article also illustrates the burdens riverine leaders faced in creating social capital configurations and the challenges of maintaining them over time. This study builds on previous research regarding the role of community leadership in rural development and provides examples of how analyzing micro-sociological processes can help identify the benefits, costs, and burdens of creating the social capital necessary to achieve development goals.

In addition to economic variables, indirect effect variables are employed to create a model that explains deforestation. Parameters are estimated following fixed-effects methodology. The results reveal that sugarcane indirectly contributed to deforestation in Brazil during the period from 2002 to 2012. The effect was estimated to be sizeable; in particular, 16.3 thousand km(2) of forest was cut by economic actors displaced by expanding sugarcane plantations.

Such carbon footprints, however, have in most cases excluded emissions from land-use change and the proposed methodologies for including this significant emissions source suffer from different shortcomings. Here, we propose a new methodology for calculating land-use change carbon footprints for agricultural commodities and illustrate this methodology by applying it to three of the most prominent agricultural commodities driving tropical deforestation: Brazilian beef and soybeans, and Indonesian palm oil. We estimate land-use change carbon footprints in 2010 to be 66 tCO(2)/t meat (carcass weight) for Brazilian beef, 0.89 tCO(2)/t for Brazilian soybeans, and 7.5tCO(2)/t for Indonesian palm oil, using a 10year amortization period. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is its flexibility: it can be applied in a tiered approach, using detailed data where it is available while still allowing for estimation of footprints for a broad set of countries and agricultural commodities; it can be applied at different scales, estimating both national and subnational footprints; it can be adopted to account both for direct (proximate) and indirect drivers of land-use change. It is argued that with an increasing commercialization and globalization of the drivers of land-use change, the proposed carbon footprint methodology could help leverage the power needed to alter environmentally destructive land-use practices within the global agricultural system by providing a tool for assessing the environmental impacts of production, thereby informing consumers about the impacts of consumption and incentivizing producers to become more environmentally responsible.","[Persson, U.

Although considered important decomposers and a food resource in freshwater food webs, little is known about the influence of environmental factors on their geographical distribution patterns, species richness and community structure. We undertook a study of the distribution of freshwater lignolytic ascomycetes in the Madre de Dios River basin in Peru along an elevational gradient from the headwater regions dominated by the Inambari and Araza Rivers to the lowlands of the Madre de Dios River. The gradient extended from 218 to 3870 m; collections were made at low (< 300 m), medium (300-1000 m) and high (> 1000 m) elevations. Three separate collecting trips were conducted during the dry seasons over 3 years. Samples of submerged woody debris were returned to the University of Illinois where they were incubated in moist chambers and examined for the presence of sexual and asexual reproductive structures, which were used for identification. GPS location, altitude, water temperature and pH were measured at the time of collection. A total of 2187 vouchered fungal collections representing 268 fungal taxa were collected. One hundred and fifty-nine taxa were collected at low elevations, 201 at middle elevations and 56 at high elevations. Only 33 of 268 taxa occurred at all three elevational ranges. Canonical analyses of principal coordinates and Sorensons Similarity Index of species based on presence/absence data revealed different structuring of freshwater fungal communities at low, middle, and high elevations, indicating a change in species composition along the Andes to Amazon elevation gradient. Mantel's tests demonstrated that beta diversity is strongly impacted by both elevation and pH as rapid taxonomic turnover was associated with both these factors. Of 140 species found in their sexual reproductive state, only ten occurred at all three elevational ranges. The most commonly occurring species was Annulatascus velatisporus, a species with a worldwide distribution. Of 128 taxa found in their asexual reproductive state, 23 occurred at all three elevational ranges. The most commonly collected species was Candelabrum broccchiatum, also a species with a worldwide distribution. Most of the taxa reported from Peru have been reported previously from Asian and/or Australian freshwater tropical habitats. One hundred and three species are new records for South America and 137 species are new records for Peru. About 80 species found in Peru have a pan-tropical distribution. Whether these distribution patterns exist due to vicariance or geodispersal remains to be determined.

In theory, the adoption of these methods can provide win-win solutions to tropical deforestation because they address the en viron men tal consequences of deforestation while increasing the welfare of forest inhabitants. However, there is little reliable data that can be used to test this hypothesis since many of the goods produced in sustainable systems do not have well-defined markets and are most often consumed at home. This paper examines the benefits of collecting and harvesting non-timber forest products in the tropics through various methods using household panel data collected in 1996 and 2000 in the Ouro Preto do Oeste region of Rondonia, Brazil. We estimate the use-value of land under forest, agriculture, and pasture and complement these estimations with census data and regession analysis. Our estimations reveal that households utilizing sustainable practices in the forms of agroforestry and the collection of non-timber forest products have significantly higher levels of diversification. We conclude that directing policy towards win-win strategies may not be desirable for reducing both poverty and deforestation in this region since we find no clear evidence that these can successfully be addressed simultaneously. Sustainable development policy should focus on increasing the value of the forest, or reducing the opportunity cost of leaving standing forest on the household lot, if sustainable production strategies are to be more attractive to households in the future.

We examine the hydrological fluxes for an Amazon floodplain lake connected to the Solimoes River using a process-based hydrologic model. Water exchanges between the river and lake agree well with field estimates, including the timing of different hydrological phases. However, beyond available field data, modeling results show that the seven simulated years all differed from each other. These interannual differences were caused by the interplay between phases when water levels were rising with river-water flowing into the lake (RWRI), versus rising with lake-water flowing out to the river (RWLO). This exchange determines the river-water content in the lake (C-L). Maximum C-L occurred before river levels peaked because local catchment contributions can be sufficient to push lake-water out to the river, even as river levels rise. Numerical experiments show that the seasonal distribution of local rainfall, local catchment size, and interannual variability in both climate and river stage can contribute to differing dynamics of C-L, in a floodplain lake. Their impacts vary among phases: river-rise dominates the RWRI, whereas local hydrological processes dominate the RWLO and receding-water phases. Intermediate-to-long-term rainfall accumulation controls C-L during the RWLO phase, whereas annual precipitation accumulation is important for C-L, during low water. Our model generalizes beyond limited available field studies and offers potential to better understand floodplain lakes in other areas and how regional versus local changes in climate may affect their hydrological dynamics.","[Ji, Xinye; Wang, Shilong; Shen, Chaopeng] Penn State Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lesack, Lance F.

Drawing from scholarship on power in agri-food governance and sustainability transitions, an analytical framework is then applied to the Brazilian case. The analysis of current policies, recent institutional changes and the case-specific literature reveals that, despite a strategic framing of the bioeconomy transition as a panacea for job creation, biodiversity conservation and local development (particularly for the Amazon region), in practice major soy, sugarcane and meatpacking conglomerates dominate Brazil's bioeconomy agenda. In what can be described as conservative ecological modernization, there is some reflexivity regarding environmental issues but also an effort to maintain (unequal) social and political structures. Significant agribusiness dominance does not bode well for smallholder farmers, food diversity or natural ecosystems, as major drivers of deforestation and land-use change (e.g., soy plantations, cattle ranching) gain renewed economic and political stimulus as well as greater societal legitimacy under the bioeconomy umbrella.","[Lima, Mairon G.

These factors influence the diversity of resources to which the poor have access and result in specializations in livelihood strategies. We analyzed the relation between forest dependence and livelihood strategies in the Bolivian Amazon, applying the SLF. We tested for the differences across strategies with respect to financial, human, physical, social, and natural livelihood assets. Results show that forest income is highly related to cash income from Brazil nut, while income from agriculture and timber exploitation is associated with higher levels of education. Brazil nuts serve as a safety net and start-up capital for certain livelihood strategies in our study region. Livelihood strategies that are based on the commercialization of multiple products from forests and agriculture and services inside and outside communities depend less on forests. Livelihoods can be supported by investing in sustainable livelihood asset endowments. Our results demonstrate that activities that aim to support community forest management and to enhance household income should explicitly consider a differentiated support for different strategies. This will result in a more effective outcome of development efforts from which the poorest people would benefit most. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we compare the manifestation of stress in the canonical stress (typically fixed) position with its manifestation in the non canonical (exceptional) position, where it would potentially be less predictable. We also compare these patterns with the manifestation of stress in Portuguese, in both the default penultimate and the less common final position.

Despite these complexities, virtually all urban land cover can be generalized as a combination of vegetation, impervious surfaces, and soil (V-I-S components), in addition to water. Previous work has demonstrated the potential of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) to model the subpixel abundance of V-I-S components. Here, the authors test whether the technique is sufficiently robust to map V-I-S components for a diverse set of cities, selecting 10 urban centers in the state of Rondonia, Brazil, to represent a range of populations, development histories, and economic activities. For each urban sample, a 20 km x 20 km region centered over the built-up area was subset from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. MESMA was applied to all subscenes using the same spectral library, model constraints, and selection rules. Accuracy of the modeled V-I-S fractions was assessed using high-resolution images mosaicked from digital aerial videography. Modeled fractions and reference fractions were highly correlated, with R-2 values exceeding 0.75 for all materials in multiple cities across a region. Model complexity, or the number of endmembers required to accurately model each pixel, was correlated with the degree of human impact on the landscape. Built-up areas, as delineated by model complexity, exhibited a strong fit to the well-established relationship between the built-up area of a settlement and its population. Finally, this work demonstrates that the V-I-S components as modeled by MESMA can capture both inter- and intraurban variability, suggesting that these data products could contribute to comparative studies of urbanizing areas through time and across regions.","[Powell, Rebecca L.] Univ Denver, Dept Geog, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Roberts, Dar A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Powell, RL (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Dept Geog, 2050 E Iliff Ave, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",rpowell8@du.edu,,,,,,,24,24,,,,,,,,,,,,2008.0,12.0,,,,,,,13,10.1175/2008EI246.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000260107400001,

The general objective of the field mission was to investigate the tropospheric minor constituent composition, known to be disturbed by biomass burning practices. This report describes ozone measurements that were made by the Brazilian component. Two field missions in central Brazil were made with the objective of investigating ozone concentrations in the biomass burning source region: one smaller mission in the wet season period, April, and a major mission in the dry season, September/October 1992. The main field expedition during the dry season obtained data over a period of about 20 days in September and a few days in October 1992, in a savanna environment of central Brazil. Simultaneous surface ozone and ozone soundings were made. In the wet season the observation site was Goiania (16 degrees S, 49 degrees W); and in the dry season, two other sites were added: Cuiaba (16 degrees S, 56 degrees W) and Porto Nacional (11 degrees S, 48 degrees W). In addition, measurements were also made at an Atlantic coast site, Natal (6 degrees S, 35 degrees W), outside of the savanna region, and not affected directly by the biomass burning source areas, used as a control site. The average behavior of the ozone concentrations at the different sites suggests that surface ozone concentrations tend to be rather uniform, despite different precipitation rates, but slightly larger at the drier sites. However, other factors, such as burning fuel, for example, or cloudiness, may be also important to determine ozone concentrations. This is reflected by large day-to-day variabilities that are common in the source region. The diurnal variation of the surface ozone concentrations maximize around 1600 LT. Hourly averages in September, at this time, amount to 47 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) at Porto Nacional and 40 ppbv at Cuiaba. For this station the values are lower than those of previous years (55 ppbv in 1991 and 48 ppbv in 1990). Only small differences, of the order of 5 ppbv, are observed between the source (burning) sites and Natal (the control site) in the wet season. In April, only 16 ppbv are observed at Natal. Much larger concentrations may be observed occasionally in the source areas, in the dry season. For example, at Porto Nacional, SO ppbv have been measured at the surface and in the lower troposphere. In comparison with the coastal site, near the surface, large scatter in concentration values at Porto Nacional (20-80 ppbv) contrast with the smaller concentration range seen at Natal (20-40 ppbv). In addition, at Natal the ozone mixing ratios below about 600 hPa are distributed around a vertical gradient in which the mixing ratios increase with height, whereas at Porto Nacional in the same height region, larger concentrations and a large scatter of the data are apparent. In the upper troposphere, perhaps surprisingly, the ozone concentrations at Natal and Porto Nacional are about equal, 70 ppbv at 10 km (with larger scatter at Natal than at Porto Nacional), probably reflecting a net production of ozone along the pathways from the source regions, coupled with its longer lifetime at the higher altitudes. This data set is consistent with the hypothesis that tropical ozone in the troposphere is produced photochemically from biomass burning products in the dry season. These products are exported from the source regions to the upper atmospheric levels by dry and wet convection and once in the upper atmospheric levels are taken eastward to the South Atlantic by the prevailing winds, where they contribute to local ozone formation. The air masses at Natal, Brazil, in the lower atmospheric levels, i.e., below about 500 hPa, originate from the South Atlantic. This allows one to classify Natal air masses as pristine over most of the year and justifies the stations use as a control station. However, the data now presented, combined with the detailed analyses of the other TRACE A studies, allows on to conclude that in the dry season, Natal ozone concentrations below about 500 hPa are perturbed by combustion products consistent with long-range transport from Africa.","NASA, LANGLEY RES CTR, DIV ATMOSPHER SCI, HAMPTON, VA 23665 USA",,"Kirchhoff, VWJH (corresponding author), INST PESQUISAS ESPACIAIS, AV ASTRONAUTAS 1758, CAIXA POSTAL 515, BR-12201970 SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, SP, BRAZIL.",,,,,,,,37,37,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 30,1996.0,101.0,D19,,,,24029,24042,,10.1029/95JD03030,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VQ49300043,

Remote sensing offers the potential to map pasture vegetation over large areas, but mapping pasture conditions consistently through time is not a trivial task because of seasonal changes associated with phenology and data gaps from clouds and cloud shadows. In this study, we tested spectral-temporal metrics derived from intra-annual Landsat time series to distinguish between grass-dominated and woody pastures. The abundance of woody vegetation on pastures is an indicator for management intensity, since the duration and intensity of land use steer secondary succession rates, apart from climate and soil conditions. We used the developed Landsat-based metrics to analyze pasture intensity trajectories between 1985 and 2012 in Novo Progresso, Brazil, finding that woody vegetation cover generally decreased after four to ten years of grazing activity. Pastures established in the 80s and early 90s showed a higher fraction of woody vegetation during their initial land use history than pastures established in the early 2000s. Historic intensity trajectories suggested a trend towards more intensive land use in the last decade, which aligns well with regional environmental policies and market dynamics. This study demonstrates the potential of dense Landsat time series to monitor land-use intensification on Amazonian pastures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The spatial distribution of these habitats influence the abundance and interactions of animal species, and the change or destruction of habitat can cause the disturbance of key biological processes. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT-2, and ENVISAT/ASAR data to map ecosystems and create a lake distribution map of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, backscattering analysis was conducted on individual training objects to gain a better understanding of the backscattering characteristics of each class. Then, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification based on hierarchical principles first classified the region into Lakes and Not Lakes. This was followed by a Level 2 classification defining six vegetation habitats (Forest Woodland, Open Wood Savanna, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland and Vazantes) which was achieved at an overall accuracy of 83%. A Level 3 classification defined the Lakes class into a) Fresh (baias) and Brackish (salinas) lakes (accuracy results of 98%); and a further classification level dividing the fresh lakes, b) Fresh lakes with floating and emergent vegetation (baias), and Fresh lakes with the presence of Typha (salobras), and including the Brackish lakes (salinas) (overall accuracy results of 81%). The results of this study provide the first fine spatial resolution classification showing the spatial distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the entire subregion of Lower Nhecolandia using dual season, dual polarization C and L-band SAR imagery.

Grasses comprised 91-94% of the total above-ground biomass in the campo limpo and campo sujo grasslands. In the campo cerrado and cerrado sensu stricto communities, graminoids comprised only 27% of the fuel load biomass; the remainder was composed of deadwood (18%), dicot leaf litter (36%), dicots and shrub leaves (18%). 3 Fires consumed greater than or equal to 97% of the above-ground biomass in the grasslands, but only 72 and 84% of the fuel load in campo cerrado and cerrado sensu stricto, respectively. The total residual mass (uncombusted fuels and ash combined) was < 8% of the prefire mass in campo limpo and campo sujo but was greater than or equal to 36% in the campo cerrado and cerrado sensu stricto. A circular relationship existed between vegetation composition, fuel composition, and fire behaviour. For example, fire-line intensity was significantly greater in grasslands, which would facilitate grass dominance by increasing above-ground tissue damage of trees and shrubs. (4) Within the fuel load, a consistently increasing pool size of N, P, C, and S was measured along the gradient from campo limpo to cerrado sensu stricto. Total mass of N increased from 24 to 55 kg ha(-1), total mass of P increased from 1.7 to 3.5 kg ha(-1), and total mass of C increased from 3389 to 4657 kg ha(-1). This trend was reversed for K (i.e. 18.5 kg ha(-1) in Campo limpo to 13.8 kg ha(-1) in cerrado sensu stricto). 5 Carbon, N, and S were the nutrients that were consistently lost in the highest quantities during fire. Losses of P were intermediate, and K and Ca were negligible. 6 The percentage of the above-ground N, C, and S pools that were lost by fire decreased along the vegetation gradient from campo limpo to cerrado sensu stricto. For example, greater than or equal to 90% of the N pool was lost by fire in the grasslands while < 56% of the N pool was lost in the tree-dominated communities. Total site loss (kg ha(-1)) of all nutrients was not significantly different among the vegetation types. However, significantly greater quantities of nutrients were lost as particulates in Cerrado sensu stricto while significantly greater quantities of nutrients were volatilized during fire in Campo limpo. 7 Nitrogen pools located in soils to a 10 cm depth ranged from 656 to 1670 kg ha(-1). Of the total N pool consisting of fuel loads and soils, the proportion in fuels ranged from 1.4% in campo limpo to 4.0% in cerrado sensu stricto. Fires resulted in ecosystem losses of < 3.8% of this pool. Ecosystem losses of this magnitude are likely to be compensated for by natural nutrient inputs in one to three years.","US FOREST SERV, INTERMT RES STN, MISSOULA, MT 59807 USA",,"KAUFFMAN, JB (corresponding author), OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT RANGELAND RESOURCES, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,,218,230,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,1994.0,82.0,3,,,,519,531,,10.2307/2261261,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PF54200009,

Aims of the study: We aim to verify in how far the HNB, created in seventeenth-century northeastern Brazil, correlates with contemporary plant use in the country by comparing the plant knowledge therein with recent plant market surveys at national level. Materials and methods: We conducted a literature review on ethnobotanical market surveys in Brazil. We used the retrieved data on plant composition and vernacular names, together with our own fieldwork from the Ver-o-Peso market in Belem, to compare each market repertoire with the useful species in the HNB. We analyzed similarities among markets and the HNB with a Detrended Correspondence Analysis and by creating Venn diagrams. We analyzed the methods of the different markets to check whether they influenced our results. Results: Out of the 24 markets reviewed, the greatest similarities with the HNB are seen in northern Brazilian markets, both in plant composition and vernacular names, followed by the northeast. The least overlap is found with markets in the central west and Rio de Janeiro. Most of the shared vernacular names with the HNB belonged to languages of the Tupi linguistic family. Conclusion: The similarity patterns in floristic composition among Brazilian markets and the HNB indicate the current wider distribution and trade of the species that Marcgrave and Piso described in 1648 in the northeast. Migration of indigenous groups, environmental changes, globalized and homogenous plant trade, and different market survey methods played a role in these results.

The Palcazu Forest Management system (strip clear-cutting) has been proposed as one sustainable alternative. However, low growth rates of commercial tree species during early regeneration indicate that strip-cutting may not be sustainable. To test whether a silvicultural treatment enhances the growth, survival, recruitment or richness of regenerating trees, we carried out an experimental thinning in 1996 within two strips cleared in 1989 at Jenaro Herrera, Peru, then censussed and remeasured trees on thinned and control plots in 2000. In addition, for strip 2, we compared tree regeneration on two felling treatments, clear-cutting and deferment-cutting. Thinning significantly enhanced annual growth increment (AGI) for stems of all regeneration categories (recruits, stump sprouts, and advance regeneration) of commercial species in strip 1, and for all categories of recruits and stump sprouts in strip 2. In most cases, mean increment in the thinned treatment was approximately twice that of the control. Recruitment, survival and richness, however, demonstrated little response to thinning. Although growth tended to be higher in clear-cut portions, significant differences in increment for felling treatment were detected for only two of seven categories on strip 2, and there was no effect of felling treatment on survival, recruitment or richness. Thinning is likely to raise the value of the second harvest on the strips by enhancing the growth rates of regenerating trees, so thinning should be included in the strip clear-cutting system. This system should not, however, be considered sustainable unless growth rates are sufficient to ensure the value of successive harvests. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

We project that without new forest conservation policies 289 million hectares of tropical forest will be cleared from 2016-2050, releasing 169 GtCO(2). A carbon price of US$20/tCO(2) ($50/tCO(2)) across tropical countries would avoid 41 GtCO(2) (77 GtCO(2)) from 2016-2050. By comparison, we estimate that Brazil's restrictive policies in the Amazon between 2004-2012 successfully decoupled potential agricultural revenue from deforestation and reduced deforestation by 47% below what would have otherwise occurred, preventing the emission of 5.2 GtCO(2). All tropical countries enacting restrictive anti-deforestation policies as effective as those in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004-2012 would avoid 58 GtCO(2) from 2016-2050.","[Busch, Jonah] Ctr Global Dev, 2055 L St NW,Fifth Floor, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Engelmann, Jens] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 427 Lorch St,Taylor Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Busch, J (corresponding author), Ctr Global Dev, 2055 L St NW,Fifth Floor, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",jbusch@cgdev.org,,,,,,,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2018.0,13.0,1,,,,,,15001,10.1088/1748-9326/aa907c,,,,,,,,WOS:000424398200001,

In order to establish comparisons with the biogeographical patterns of other vertebrates, previous cladistic analyses reported in the literature (for lizards and primates) were extended and reanalysed to match the geographical scope of the anuran analysis: Cladistic analysis of the distribution of 335 anuran species at 14 localities showed two regions that form a basal dichotomy: (1) Central America + Choco and (2) Amazon Basin + Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This result is interpreted as the first vicariance event that separated lowland Neotropical rainforests into Cis-Andean (east from the Andes) and Trans-Andean (west from the Andes) areas. Within the Cis-Andean localities, the earliest separation occurred between the Amazon Basin and the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Within the Amazon Basin, three distinctive clusters are defined: (1) Belem, (2) Guianan Region, and (3) Upper Amazon Basin. Data sets on the distribution of anurans, lizards, and mammals have strong cladistic signal. Strong congruence exists among the area cladograms of anurans, lizards, and primates. All of them have, or at least did not conflict with: (1) a basal separation between Cis- and Trans-Andean regions, (2) a Central American clade, (3) the Choco Region is sister to the Central;American clade, (4) an Amazon Basin clade, (5) an Upper Amazon Basin clade, and (6) a Guianan clade. The area cladograms are dichotomous and therefore do not support biogeographic theories that hypothesize simultaneous isolations of biotas in the Neotropics.

This paper reports on a study of forest fallow management among Amazonian peasant farmers in a traditional, riverside community near Iquitos, Peru. Data were gathered through in-depth household interviews (n = 36) on farming practices, demographic characteristics, kinship relations and family history, income-expenditures and household wealth. Field visits and interviews allowed the reconstruction of forest fallow histories (n = 593 fields) for the period of 1950-1994. These histol ies were combined with information on household land holding and demographic composition, over time, and incorporated into a panel data set for analysis of fallow dynamics at the plot and household level. Our analyses indicate marked variations among households in the area, number and age of fallow holdings through time. Tobit regressions suggest that households with better access to land and to both in-house (male) and communal labour hold more land in secondary forest fallow with longer fallow periods. Over time, as primary forest lands around the community became increasingly scarce, households increased their holdings of forest Fallow but reduced the fallow length. Duration analyses at the plot level indicate that fallow length is influenced primarily by the type of prior crop, field size, and household access to labour as well as primary forest. Land poorer households have significantly shorter forest fallows than better-off households. Our findings point to the importance of intra-community variations in non-market mediated access to land and labour and their implications for secondary forest fallow management among traditional peoples in tropical rain forest regions.

This paper examines the land-use choices of small-scale farmers in Ouro Preto do Oeste, Rondonia, Brazil and investigates how agricultural production impacts deforestation levels. The data used to explore these issues consist of a panel collected from 152 households in 1996 and 2000. Overall, the empirical models indicate that access to credit, wealth, lot size, product markets, and off-farm labor opportunities, largely influence deforestation and production decisions. Among other things, the results suggest that more sustainable production methods are unlikely to be adopted by a majority of households under current conditions because the production of milk has rapidly advanced due to its moderate labor requirements and existing market infrastructure. Households with greater levels of wealth have focused on milk while those with access to credit have focused on crops. Since the production of crops is largely influenced by access to credit, similar incentives may be proposed to support more sustainable production activities to help reduce deforestation.","Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA",,"Caviglia-Harris, JL (corresponding author), Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",jlcaviglia-harris@salisbury.edu,,,,,,,42,42,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2004.0,9.0,,2,,,181,202,,10.1017/S1355770X03001165,,,,,,,,WOS:000221253700004,

While the biophysical and observational factors driving variations in apparent shadow are known, little quantitative information exists on the magnitude and variability of shadow in remotely sensed data acquired over tropical regions. Even less is known about shadow effects in multispectral observations from satellites (e.g., Landsat). The IKONOS satellite, with 1-m panchromatic and 4-m multispectral capabilities, provides an opportunity to observe tropical canopies and their shadows at spatial scales approaching the size of individual crowns and vegetation clusters. We used 44 IKONOS images from the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) data archive to quantify the spatial variation of canopy shadow fraction across a broad range of forests in the Brazilian Amazon and savannas in the Brazilian Cerrado. Forests had substantial apparent shadow fractions as viewed from the satellite vantage point. The global mean (+/-S.D.) shadow fraction was 0.25 +/- 0.12, and within-scene (e.g., forest stand) variability was similar to interscene (e.g., regional) variation. The distribution of shadow fractions for forest stands was skewed, with 30% of pixels having fractional shadow values above 0.30. Shadow fractions in savannas increased from 0.0 +/- 0.0 1 to 0.12 +/- 0.04 to 0.16 +/- 0.05 for areas with woody vegetation at low (<25% cover), medium (25-75%), and high (>75%) density, respectively. Landsat-like observations using both red (0.63-0.70 mum) and near-infrared (NIR) (0.76-0.85 mum) wavelength regions were highly sensitive to sub-pixel shadow fractions in tropical forests, accounting for similar to30-50% of the variance in red and NIR responses. A 10% increase in shadow fraction resulted in a 3% and 10% decrease in red and NIR channel response, respectively. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of tropical forests was weakly sensitive to changes in shadow fraction. For low-, medium-, and high-density savannas,a 10% increase in shadow fraction resulted in a 5-7% decrease in red-channel response. Shadows accounted for similar to15-50% of the overall variance in red-wavelength responses in the savanna image archive. Weak to no relationship occurred between shadow fraction and either NIR reflectance or the NDVI of savannas. Quantitative information on shadowing is needed to validate or constrain radiative transfer, spectral mixture, and land-surface models used to estimate material and energy exchanges between the tropical biosphere and atmosphere.

In Brazil, deforestation has been closely coupled to the expansion of grazing and cropping systems primarily in the tropical forest, but no spatially explicit high resolution database on deforestation exists that captures tropical forest clearing prior to 2000. The open Landsat archive provides > 45 years of imagery and is well suited for wall-to-wall assessments of historic deforestation dynamics which are valuable to policy development and environmental impact assessments. Image analysis procedures for reconstructing long-term deforestation dynamics over large areas need to cope with regions and time periods for which the archive contains heterogeneous data densities on a yearly and decadal basis. We create for the first time yearly 30 m maps of long term, annual deforestation dynamics (LTAD) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 for Path and Mato Grosso, two Brazilian federal states that cover much of the Brazilian arc-of-deforestation. Our results provide valuable insights into historic deforestation trends, with annually increasing deforestation from 1990 to 1999 for both Para and Mato Grosso. Peak deforestation occurred in 2004 after which deforestation leveled off - with a more pronounced decrease in Mato Grosso than in Path. Contrary to Mato Grosso, Para again experienced increasing annual forest clearing in recent years. For the time period after 2000, we provide an indepth comparison with two widely used products, the Brazilian PRODES and the Global Forest Change maps (GFC, Hansen et al., 2013). Our deforestation estimates (407,000 +/- 42,000 km(2) at 95% confidence level) are above those provided by PRODES, while GFC results are closer to our estimates for the comparison period. Recent PRODES estimates are consistently below our and the GFC results. Overall, our results exemplify the potential of open image archives for multi-decadal, wall-to-wall and fine grain reconstruction of forest change.

Management of the FLONAs includes the levying of stumpage fees and administration taxes to generate operating revenue and foster more sustainable logging practices. We consider alternative policies available to FLONA administrators that, under a certain set of assumptions, are sufficient to indemnify some social costs of tropical deforestation. Specifically, we look at various rates of profit and severance tax and examine how these affect logging firms' decisions regarding harvest rates and how these taxes might be used to establish an indemnity fund.

The approach is empirical and relies on an extended amount of forest inventory data for model calibration. We used a total of 368 sample plots with 469 ha from primary forest and 330 sample plots with 30.8 ha from secondary forest. The data come from eight countries and are distributed over tropical forests in all of Amazonia. We interpolated primary forest descriptors spatially in virtue of their dependence on biophysical conditions. Secondary forest parameters were described by a set of differential equations, in which the primary forest functioned as asymptotes of the growth processes. A state-space approach to growth modeling allowed for derivation of other forest parameters from models for state variables by auxiliary relationships. The fitted models offer a spatially explicit description of growth and increment over all the tropical forests in Amazonia on a large scale. As a function of biophysiology and of forest age, the models specify individual secondary forest growth curves at the level of grid cells. We calculated grids for forest parameters and their increments in primary and secondary forests of various ages. In primary forest, total basal area ranged between 22 and 33 m(2) ha(-1), top height was 10-35 m, there were 400-850 individuals per hectare, and standing alive above-ground biomass ranged between 110 and 370 t ha-1. The biomass model was validated by comparing predictions at various successional stages from different locations in Amazonia against independent reference data. Despite a small negative bias, the RMSE for standing alive above-ground biomass amounted to only 38 t ha(-1). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Using empirical relationships derived from a global analysis, we predicted potential aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) for the region's regrowth forests based on soil texture and climate data. For regrowth forests on nonsandy soils, the globally derived relationship provided a nearly unbiased linear predictor of Amazonian validation data consisting of 66 stands at seven sites; there was no significant difference between stands that regrew following use as pasture land and those that regrew following slash-and-burn agriculture. For regrowth forests on nonsandy soil, the 1 sigma error range of our ABA model was 58%-171% for the Amazonian validation data. For regrowth forests on sandy soils, the validation data were limited to 19 stands at one site, and the globally derived relationship was substantially biased multiplicatively and nonlinearly. Hence we developed a regional refinement by adding to our validation data ABA values from the two Amazonian sites with sandy soil that had previously been included in the global analysis. Based on a conservative jackknife goodness-of-fit assessment (leaving out one site at a time), we calculated a 1 sigma error range of 42%-158% for our sandy soil Amazonian regrowth forest ABA model. We present our predictions of potential regrowth forest ABA as a set of 0.5 degrees resolution maps for the region at 5, 10, and 20 years following abandonment.","Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources, Durham, NH 03824 USA; Univ Florida, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Zarin, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, POB 110410, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",zarin@ufl.edu,,,,,,,49,52,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2001.0,4.0,7,,,,658,668,,10.1007/s10021-001-0035-y,,,,,,,,WOS:000172503300004,

The area, with a total of 17336 km(2), has been subject to significant LULC changes associated with deforestation progress and use of fire. Considering available Landsat time series, it was selected an image per year from 1984 to 2013 (path/row -231/66), at a particular period of year, atmospherically corrected using LEDAPS tools. NDVIs values were generated for each selected image. Furthermore, the images of 1984 and 2010 still underwent a classification of LULC differentiate five categories: water, forest, secondary/degraded forest, savannah/pasture and crop/bare soil. The trajectories in NDVI variation values were analysed by R software, considering intersections of classified categories. The pixels identified as forests on the images of 1984 and 2010 displayed stable trajectories of NDVI values, with average value 0.824 and coefficient of variation 3.9%. While the pixels of savannah/pasture, which was periodically affected by fire, had an average NDVI value 0.585 and coefficient of variation 15,1%. The main regressive trajectory was the transition forest to crop/bare soil, identifying 1999 as the starting point in the drop in NDVI values, associated with an increase of the deforested areas. Therefore, the results show distinct trajectories associated with NDVIs and LULC changes that assist in better understanding the dynamics of ecological processes and the human impacts operating in the area.","[Alves, D.

Herein, molecular, morphological, and bioacoustic evidence are combined to assess species limits within D. parviceps, a widely distributed species in the Amazon Basin. Phylogenetic relationships were assessed using 3040 bp sequences of mitochondrial DNA, genes 12S, ND1, and CO1. The phylogeny shows three well-supported clades. Bioacoustic and morphological divergence is congruent with those clades demonstrating that Dendropsophus parviceps is a species complex. Dendropsophus parviceps sensu stricto occurs in the Amazon basin of Ecuador, northern Peru, southern Colombia and northwestern Brazil. It is sister to two previously undescribed species, D. kubricki sp. n. from central Peru and D. kamagarini sp. n. from southern Peru, northeastern Bolivia, and northwestern Brazil. Genetic distances (uncorrected p, gene 12S) between D. parviceps and the new species is 3 to 4%. Dendropsophus kamagarini sp. n. can be distinguished from D. parviceps by having a prominent conical tubercle on the distal edge of the upper eyelid (tubercle absent in D. parviceps). Dendropsophus kubricki sp. n. differs from D. parviceps by having scattered low tubercles on the upper eyelids (smooth in D. parviceps). Dendropsophus parviceps and both new species differ from all their congeners by their small size (adult maximum SVL = 28.39 mm in females, 22.73 mm in males) and by having a bright orange blotch on the hidden areas of the shanks and under arms. The advertisement call of the two new species has lower dominant frequency relative to D. parviceps. Probable speciation modes are discussed. Available evidence indicates that ecological speciation along an elevation gradient is unlikely in this species complex.","[Rivadeneira, C.

Among many sources, the multi-decade Landsat archive is certainly the best known, but legacy and current data from other sensors is available as well through the USGS data portals: these include CBERS, ASTER, and more. Though the particular band combinations or non-global missions have made their integration into analyses more challenging, these data, in conjunction with the entire Landsat record, are available to contribute to multi-decade surveys of land-cover change. With the goal of tracing forest change through time near the Roosevelt River in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, we used BULC and Google Earth Engine to fuse information from 13 space-borne imagers capturing 140 images spanning 45 years. With high accuracy, the resulting time series of classifications shows the timing and location of land-use/land-cover change-both deforestation and regrowth-at sub-annual time scales. Accuracy estimates showed that the synthesized BULC classification time series was better than nearly all of the single-day image classifications, covering the entire study area at sub-annual frequency while reducing the impact of clouds and most unwanted noise as it fused information derived from a wide array of imaging platforms. The time series improved and gradually sharpened as the density of observations increased in recent decades, when there were three or more clear, higher-resolution views of a pixel annually from any sensor combination. In addition to detailing the methodology and results of multi-source data fusion with the BULC approach, this study raises timely points about integrating information from early satellite data sources and from sensors with footprints smaller than Landsat's. There are decades of research deriving sensor-specific techniques for classifying land use and land cover from a single image in a variety of settings. The BULC approach leverages the many successes of single-sensor research and can be used as a straightforward, complementary tool for blending many good-quality mapped classifications from disparate sources into a coherent, high-quality time series.","[Fortin, Julie A.; Cardille, Jeffrey A.; Perez, Elijah] Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21,111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Fortin, Julie A.; Perez, Elijah] McGill Sch Environm, 21,111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada",,"Cardille, JA (corresponding author), Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21,111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",jeffrey.cardille@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,17,18,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1,2020.0,238.0,,,,,,,111266,10.1016/j.rse.2019.111266,,,,,,,,WOS:000523955200011,

Direct or indirect effects can be related to climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, floods, landslides, etc. As such a significant process, timely and continuous monitoring of forest dynamics is important, to constantly follow existing policies and develop new mitigation measures. The present work had the aim of mapping and monitoring the forest change from 2000 to 2019 and of simulating the future forest development of a rainforest region located in the Para state, Brazil. The land cover dynamics were mapped at five-year intervals based on a supervised classification model deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine. Besides the benefits of reduced computational time, the service is coupled with a vast data catalogue providing useful access to global products, such as multispectral images of the missions Landsat five, seven, eight and Sentinel-2. The validation procedures were done through photointerpretation of high-resolution panchromatic images obtained from CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite). The more than satisfactory results allowed an estimation of peak deforestation rates for the period 2000-2006; for the period 2006-2015, a significant decrease and stabilization, followed by a slight increase till 2019. Based on the derived trends a forest dynamics was simulated for the period 2019-2028, estimating a decrease in the deforestation rate. These results demonstrate that such a fusion of satellite observations, machine learning, and cloud processing, benefits the analysis of the forest dynamics and can provide useful information for the development of forest policies.","[Brovelli, Maria Antonia; Sun, Yaru; Yordanov, Vasil] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn DICA, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Yordanov, Vasil] Vasil Levski Natl Mil Univ, Gen Troops Fac, Veliko Tarnovo 5000, Bulgaria",,"Brovelli, MA (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn DICA, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",maria.brovelli@polimi.it; yaru.sun@mail.polimi.it; vasil.yordanov@polimi.it,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2020.0,9.0,10,,,,,,580,10.3390/ijgi9100580,,,,,,,,WOS:000587403200001,

Individuals analyzed in this study were captured in localities between 200 and 500 m altitude, in the department of Guaviare. Each sample was screened for haemosporidian parasites by using morphology and a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol that targets the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene. Four morphotypes of the genus Plasmodium were found; two of these species are re-described using morphological and molecular data (cytb). For the other two morphotypes, it was not possible to assign a described species. Among those, Plasmodium screened one species was only detected by microscopy. Considering the potential species diversity, it is possible that commonly used primers may not detect all species, reinforcing the importance of using microscopy in haematozoa surveys. There was no correspondence between the morphological traits associated with the subgenera and the phylogenetic relationships that we found in our analyses.

The number of fires in the Amazon has increased in recent years, but whether this increase was driven by deforestation or climate has not been assessed. We analyzed relationships between fire, deforestation, and climate for the period 2003 to 2019 among selected states across the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA). A statistical model including deforestation, precipitation and temperature explained similar to 80% of the variability in dry season fire count across states when totaled across the BLA, with positive relationships between fire count and deforestation. We estimate that the increase in deforestation since 2012 increased the dry season fire count in 2019 by 39%. Using a regional chemistry-climate model combined with exposure-response associations, we estimate this increase in fire resulted in 3,400 (95UI: 3,300-3,550) additional deaths in 2019 due to increased exposure to particulate air pollution. If deforestation in 2019 had increased to the maximum recorded during 2003-2019, the number of active fire counts would have increased by an additional factor of 2 resulting in 7,900 (95UI: 7,600-8,200) additional premature deaths.

Plain Language Summary Exposure to air pollution created from fires in the Amazon fires has detrimental impacts on human health. The number of active fires across the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) has increased in recent years, but the reason for this increase has not been fully assessed to-date. Using a statistical model, we found that increases in BLA deforestation rate since 2012 increased dry season fire count in 2019 by 39%. Using a regional chemistry-climate model, we estimated that this increase in fire count resulted in 3,400 (95UI: 3,300-3,550) additional human deaths in 2019 due to increased population exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution. We also found that if deforestation in 2019 had increased to the maximum recorded during 2003-2019, the number of active fires would have increased by an additional factor of 2 resulting in 7,900 (95UI: 7,600-8,200) additional deaths.

In my discussion of rainforest aesthetics, I focus on two Brazilian films, made ten years apart: Glauber Rocha's short Amazonas, Amazonas (Amazon, Amazon, 1965); and Iracema, uma transa amazonica (Iracema: An Amazonian Love Affair, 1975), by Jorge Bodanzky and Orlando Senna. I interpret the depiction of nature in both of these films as an instantiation of what I call rainforest sublime. Despite their similarities, I argue that the two movies resort to sublimity to convey contrasting portrayals of the Amazon. While Rocha goes back to an age-old narrative of economic progress as a response to the natural sublime, Bodanzky and Senna's rainforest sublimity is more nuanced and chimes in with environmentalist discourses in its firm rejection of unbridled development and in its call for a respectful approach to Amazonia.","[Vieira, Patricia] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal; [Vieira, Patricia] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",,"Vieira, P (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal.; Vieira, P (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020.0,103.0,4,,,,533,543,,10.1353/hpn.2020.0113,,,,,,,,WOS:000607181700011,

Forests continue to fall and agriculture to move in to a region with patchy (in terms of agronomic potential) yet broadly nutrient-poor soils. The spatial distribution of soil types is not well mapped at finer scales relevant for agriculture. There is, moreover, little evidence about how farm land use or farm household welfare varies by soil quality in this frontier setting. Despite these information gaps, regional planners continue to use soils as a basis for policy action, some of which may influence future options for the Amazon. This paper uses a farm-level bioeconomic model that captures soil-quality-specific degrading effects of agricultural activities to assess the impacts of soil quality diiferences on deforestation, use of cleared land, and smallholder income in the western Brazilian Amazon. Focusing on an archetypical area farm with reasonable market access but limited access to labor and credit, simulations show soil quality mattered more for income than for deforestation or land use, although extremely cash-strapped farmers on poor-quality soils could face displacement. Pasture dominated farm land use across all soil types as farm forest disappeared within a generation on successfully established farms. Good- and (viable) poor-soil farms had slightly slower deforestation rates than their medium-soil counterparts - rich-soil farms shifting small amounts of area (and labor) to the more nutrient- and labor-intensive annuals, and (even viable) poor-soil farms lacking sufficient resources to clear and farm additional land. Farms with good soils could generate about 44 per cent more income than their viable poor-soil counterparts, but the lower-income level still surpassed thresholds for meeting food security and other needs. At no combination of income level and soil quality explored did the (simulated) farmer find it worthwhile to purchase and apply chemical fertilizer; nutrients came instead from secondary forest fallow, whose area rose or fell in step with annual cropping area. The implications of these results for land-use zoning, forest conservation, poverty alleviation, and other policies are discussed.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Nat Resourves Policy Anal, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, John Muir Inst Environm, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Ctr Econ Cooperat, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Witcover, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Nat Resourves Policy Anal, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",vosti@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2006.0,11.0,,3,,,343,370,,10.1017/S1355770X0600283X,,,,,,,,WOS:000238347400004,

The spatial representation of current major land uses formally combines agricultural statistics from Brazil's latest census of the year 2006 at micro-region level and the Food and Agriculture Organization 2010 forest statistics with spatial land cover data sets. Spatial allocation (downscaling) algorithms were applied to obtain a spatial distribution of seven major land use categories. Remaining shares in each grid-cell were termed residual land, and were categorized according to legal protection status, biodiversity value, and whether they belong to the territory of the Amazon biome. We found a total of 84 Mha residual land of which 37 Mha occurred outside the territory of the Amazon biome and was neither legally protected nor categorized as highly biodiverse land. The 37 Mha available residual land equates to 4.4% of Brazil's geographical area and to 50% of its current cultivated land area. We assessed land quality using the Agro-ecological Zones modelling framework provides land suitability and productivity estimates of the available residual land. Nearly one-third of land emerged of prime quality and is therefore promising for biofuel feedstock production. Analysis of potential food-fuel competition suggests that until 2030 productivity improvements on current pastures could accommodate land demand for Brazil's increasing cattle herd and expanding croplands. If these productivity increases could be achieved on current agricultural land, residual land could provide areas for the sustainable expansion of biofuel feedstock production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using participatory rural appraisal, resource diaries, and household questionnaires, we study the impacts of CCP logging contracts on livelihoods, including household income and NTFP harvests. Our results show that annual household income from the CCP logging is equivalent to more than 8 years of household gross income from agricultural production. We also found that there were no significant differences in NTFP harvests between households with CCP logging and those without. In CCP-logging communities, households caught 11.9 +/- 13.6 game animals, totaling 74 +/- 88 kg of game meat. In the communities without CCP, households caught 9.5 +/- 13.0 game animals, totaling 73 +/- 172 kg of game meat.

These samples uniformly have high He-3 concentrations which must arise from long periods of cosmic ray exposure. From coexisting phases from the Quadrilatero Ferrifero in east central Brazil, we determined the ratio of cosmogenic He-3 in hematite to that of Ne-21 in quartz to be 3.96 +/- 0.19. Combined with best current estimates of the Ne-21 production rate in quartz, this ratio implies a sea-level high latitude (SLHL) He-3 production rate in hematite of 68.1 +/- 8.1 atoms/g/yr; from the chemical composition we estimate the He-3 production rate in goethite to be similar to 5% higher. We use these production rate estimates to interpret He-3 concentrations measured in goethite and hematite from a similar to 10 m depth profile collected from a surface canga in Carajas, in the Amazon basin of Brazil. We find that the Carajas canga has experienced a very low rate of surface erosion (similar to 0.16-0.54 m/Myr) over at least the last few millions of years. This iron-rich canga surface is remarkably resistant to erosion despite its location in a wet tropical environment. Details of the depth profile suggest that despite its stability, the canga has also been internally dynamic (translocation of material; solution and reprecipitation) over million-year timescales.

Our findings from nearly 700 communities suggest that the forest and lakes near riverine communities have been impoverished over the past 50 years, especially of vulnerable species of high commercial value. A zone of species depletion is detected around the two major regional cities of Iquitos and Pucallpa as well as around an important oil town. Local extirpations are common though some recovery is noted for specific fish and timber species. Expected yields are falling and evidence is found for harvesting of previously non-preferred species. Newer communities face lower initial availability of wild resources and forest impoverishment is driven by market demand over subsistence needs.

We apply this approach to a case study of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and identify three modeling steps as sources of uncertainty: model structure, variable selection, and data preprocessing. For these three steps, we quantify the uncertainty and the respective impact on the outcome accuracy. The results indicate remarkable uncertainties in each of the steps. We demonstrate that a higher uncertainty in the land-change modeling process does not necessarily lead to a lower accuracy of the modeling outcome. Moreover, we show that the different uncertainty sources only slightly influence the ratio between quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement for the modeling outcome. We conclude that uncertainty is inherent in land-change modeling, and that future studies should address this uncertainty more explicitly to improve the robustness of modeling outcomes for science and decision-making.","[Krueger, Carsten; Lakes, Tobia] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",,"Kruger, C (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",carsten.krueger@geo.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2,2015.0,29.0,1,,,,111,131,,10.1080/13658816.2014.949265,,,,,,,,WOS:000350367900006,

French Guiana experienced two gold rushes influenced by the price of gold, first during the gold standard period, he second during the Chinese supercycle. The first wave of diverse ethnic groups searching for El Dorado came mainly from the Caribbean and Metropolitan France. Most companies did not survive the lack of infrastructure, the harsh rainforest conditions, and the end of the gold standard. After 1910, the frontier disintegrated due to the remoteness of the mine sites and the State's inability to control the territory. The current commodity frontier is a combination of an industrial front driven by French and international investments in the Northern Belt, and an artisanal illegal infiltration of Brazilian garimpeiros moving north of the Amazonian front.

It has been the subject of interdisciplinary research by specialists in marine environmental history, ethnozoology and anthropology. Manatee species, Thrichechus inunguis and Thrichechus manatus, form part of the local culture and traditions of their distribution regions: subtropical and tropical regions, as well as the entire Amazon basin and its Atlantic range. The estimated number of manatees in Brazil when the Europeans first arrived was in the tens of thousands. But the several uses of this exotic, large and strange New World creature not only meant that it featured from early times in literature, folklore and mythology, but also led to hunting and therefore falling populations. We have collected information from documentary sources that referred to manatees. These derived mainly from the early modern era, and included travel books, letters from Portuguese and Spanish missionaries and explorers, chronicles, scientific treatises, illustrated broadsheets, leaflets and images in naturalists' records, sailors' reports, folklore sources, poetry and literature. Our main goal was to frame and discuss the first historical accounts of the human exploitation, uses and perceptions of manatees in the Americas. This facilitated analysis of the abundance and uses of manatees from the sixteenth century to this day, as well as discussion of conservation issues, which started to emerge during the mid-eighteenth century, around overexploited resources in colonial Brazil. In focusing on manatees, and other aquatic animals, we offer paradigmatic case studies of past ecosystems and the historical relationships between people and nature.","[Vieira, Nina; Brito, Cristina] Univ Acores, Univ Nova Lisboa, FCSH, CHAM, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Vieira, N (corresponding author), Univ Acores, Univ Nova Lisboa, FCSH, CHAM,Ctr Humanidades, Ave Berna 26-C, P-1069061 Lisbon, Portugal.",ninavieira@campus.fcsh.unl.pt,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2017.0,29.0,3,,,,513,528,,10.1177/0843871417713683,,,,,,,,WOS:000407453900004,

The region is characterized by annual floodings and a pronounced dry season of three months. We examined the influence of flooding from low to high terrain on floristic composition, forest structure and aboveground live biomass (AGB). We recorded all trees (dbh >5 cm) in 30 permanent plots (50 x 50 m) located at different topographic positions across a flooding gradient. Sixty-nine tree species from 30 plant families were recorded; Fabaceae (15 species) was the most abundant family, followed by Myrtaceae (5), Anacardiaceae (4) and Rubiaceae (4). Family composition was similar to Central Amazonian floodplain forests and many widely distributed flood-tolerant tree species were shared. Tree species richness was relatively low with 14-31 tree species per plot and was not affected by flood level, but tree species composition and family importance values differed markedly between annually flooded and non-annually flooded forest stands. Forest top canopy height varied between 10.5 and 18.5 m and was negatively correlated with flood level (R-2 = 0.25, p = 0.002). Mean wood specific gravity (WSG) of the plots increased with the flood level (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.001) and apparently was unrelated to drought intensity. Stem density (plot mean 1040 ha(-1)), mean dbh, tree basal area (19.4 m(2) ha(-1)) and AGB (116.8 Mg ha(-1)) were not dependent on flood level. The low AGB compared to Central Amazonian floodplain forests is probably a result of the pronounced dry season and limited nutrient availability in the igapo forests of the Araguaia floodplain. In view of the predicted increase of extended drought periods with global warming, we assume that future forests in the study area may lose some or all drought-sensitive tree species and likely may face a reduction in AGB.

The Amazon foreland basin became emerged in the Late Miocene-Pliocene times. In this study, trace element chemistry (n=104) and Nd-Sr isotopic systematic (n=30) are used to constrain the provenance of the Miocene tidal sediments and of the Late Miocene-Pliocene fluvial sediments. Neogene Amazonian foreland basin sediments are the result of a mixing between Andean andesitic volcanic rocks and cratonic shield rocks. The south Amazonian foreland basin (SAFB) sediments are the result of long-term weathering, recycling, and erosion of the Brazilian shield and Andean Paleozoic/Mesozoic rocks also Brazilian shield in provenance. Compared with north Amazonian foreland basin (NAFB) sediments, SAFB sediments are more felsic. NAFB sediments have 3 distinct signatures: i) an upper crust signature with trace element characteristics similar to PAAS and UCC and with epsilon Nd(0) values between -8 and -11.9; ii) an arc andesitic rock signature with high Cr/Th ratios, low Eu anomalies, low Th/Sc ratios and epsilon Nd(0) values between -3 and -5; and iii) a cratonic signature with high Eu anomalies and Zr/Sc ratios and with a very low epsilon Nd(0) value (-15.5). Our data indicate that most of the basic detritus came from the Ecuadorian Andes. In the distal part of the NAFB, the successive uplifts of the Iquitos forebulge were responsible for Late Miocene to Pliocene divide between Andean and cratonic drainage systems.

Here we present a spatially explicit quantification of the extent to which cultivated land and grassland expanded at the expense of forests across Latin America in 2001-2011, by combining two state-of-the-art global datasets (Global Forest Change forest loss and GlobeLand30-2010 land cover). We further evaluate some of the limitations and challenges in doing this. We find that this approach does capture some of the major patterns of land cover following deforestation, with GlobeLand30-2010's Grassland class (which we interpret as pasture) being the most common land cover replacing forests across Latin America. However, our analysis also reveals some major limitations to combining these land cover datasets for quantifying pasture and cropland expansion into forest. First, a simple one-to-one translation between GlobeLand30-2010's Cultivated land and Grassland classes into cropland and pasture respectively, should not be made without caution, as GlobeLand30-2010 defines its Cultivated land to include some pastures. Comparisons with the TerraClass dataset over the Brazilian Amazon and with previous literature indicates that Cultivated land in GlobeLand30-2010 includes notable amounts of pasture and other vegetation (e.g. in Paraguay and the Brazilian Amazon). This further suggests that the approach taken here generally leads to an underestimation (of up to similar to 60%) of the role of pasture in replacing forest. Second, a large share (similar to 33%) of the Global Forest Change forest loss is found to still be forest according to GlobeLand30-2010 and our analysis suggests that the accuracy of the combined datasets, especially for areas with heterogeneous land cover and/or small-scale forest loss, is still too poor for deriving accurate quantifications of land cover following forest loss.","[Pendrill, Florence; Persson, U.

In addition, a standard database is being established in collaboration with IPGRI, to promote information on germplasm exchange. The project, which started in 1997 and ended in 2001, has produced an inventory of the germplasm held in its collections, allowing exchange and repatriation of lost germplasm. The list of descriptors has been revised. Multivariate analyses of the morphological data have produced consistent results. Molecular characterization, based on RELP of genomic DNA and PCR-RFLP of cpDNA has confirmed the proximity of Ananas and Pseudananas, the absence of interspecific barriers in Ananas, the importance of a geographic component of variation, and the existence of a higher genetic diversity in the North of South America. Pineapple taxonomy has been revised. Genetic mapping was based on isozyme, RAPD, AFLP and ISSR markers and was carried out on a hybrid progeny between A. bracteatus and A. comosus, following the pseudotestcross approach. It resulted in a first map of 390 and 174 DNA markers distributed in 46 and 31 linkage groups for these two species. New sources of resistance to fusariosis have been identified, some of which show other interesting traits for the Brazilian producers. According to the first inheritance studies, this resistance seems monogenic and dominant, a result still to be confirmed. Self-progenies obtained from the cultivars Perolera, Primavera, and Roxo de Tefe, showed inbreeding depression, but normal segregation for major leaf traits (spininess, colour).

Recent expansion of mechanized agriculture in forested regions of Amazonia has increased the average size of deforested areas, but related changes in fire dynamics remain poorly characterized. We estimated the contribution of fires from the deforestation process to total fire activity based on the local frequency of active fire detections from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. High-confidence fire detections at the same ground location on 2 or more days per year are most common in areas of active deforestation, where trunks, branches, and stumps can be piled and burned many times before woody fuels are depleted. Across Amazonia, high-frequency fires typical of deforestation accounted for more than 40% of the MODIS fire detections during 2003-2007. Active deforestation frontiers in Bolivia and the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rondonia contributed 84% of these high-frequency fires during this period. Among deforested areas, the frequency and timing of fire activity vary according to postclearing land use. Fire usage for expansion of mechanized crop production in Mato Grosso is more intense and more evenly distributed throughout the dry season than forest clearing for cattle ranching (4.6 vs. 1.7 fire days per deforested area, respectively), even for clearings > 200 ha in size. Fires for deforestation may continue for several years, increasing the combustion completeness of cropland deforestation to nearly 100% and pasture deforestation to 50-90% over 1-3-year timescales typical of forest conversion. Our results demonstrate that there is no uniform relation between satellite-based fire detections and carbon emissions. Improved understanding of deforestation carbon losses in Amazonia will require models that capture interannual variation in the deforested area that contributes to fire activity and variable combustion completeness of individual clearings as a function of fire frequency or other evidence of postclearing land use.","[Morton, D.

Particularly, tropical deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity decline and substantial carbon emissions. Regrowth of secondary vegetation may help to restore habitat for many threatened species and improve ecosystem services that deteriorated due to deforestation. However, spatial-temporal patterns of regrowing secondary vegetation in the tropics remain weakly understood. We therefore analyze regrowth dynamics across two different land use systems in southern Amazonia: the extensive pastoralism in Para and the capital-intensive agriculture in Mato Grosso. Both systems are connected by the BR-163 highway, which represents a major axis of deforestation and agricultural development in the Brazilian Amazon since decades. We used a 29 year time series of Landsat images to extract regrowth extent, duration, lag time between deforestation and regrowth, and frequency of regrowth cycles. Our results reached an overall accuracy of 89% and showed regrowth on up to 50% of the deforested area in Para and a maximum of 25% in Mato Grosso. In both states, annual regrowth rates drastically dropped after 1996, which coincided with socioeconomic transformations and drought events. The majority of regrowth was concentrated within 60 m distance to forest edges and cleared again after an average of 5 years. Our approach bears great potential for mapping post deforestation regrowth dynamics within and beyond the Brazilian Amazon based on long-term and freely accessible remote sensing data collections, such as the Landsat and the forthcoming Sentinel-2 archives.

In conclusion, morete is a good source of oil and the heat treatment technology will allow improving extraction, industrializing, and offering an alternative oil for food.","[Rivera, Maritza] Fundacien Caminos Sol, Ave Atahualpa 644 & Ave Ruminahui, Ambato, Ecuador; [Ramos, Milton; Silva, Monica; Alvarez, Mario] Univ Tecn Ambato, Fac Ciencia & Ingn Alimentos & Biotecnol, Campus Huachi,Av Los Chasquis & Rio Payamino, Ambato 180206, Ecuador; [Briceno, Jorge] Univ Estatal Bolivar, Direcc Invest & Vinculac, Av Ernesto Che Guevara & Gabriel Secaira, Guaranda 020150, Ecuador",,"Silva, M (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Ambato, Fac Ciencia & Ingn Alimentos & Biotecnol, Campus Huachi,Av Los Chasquis & Rio Payamino, Ambato 180206, Ecuador.",mdp.silva@uta.edu.ec,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR-AUG,2022.0,35.0,1,,,,98,111,,10.17163/lgr.n35.2022.08,,,,,,,,WOS:000778211000009,

We test a hybrid, low-cost method of mapping ES indicators over large scales in Para State, Brazil. Four ES indicators (vegetation carbon stocks, biodiversity index, soil chemical quality index and rates of water infiltration into soil) were measured in the field and then summarized spatially for regional land-cover classes derived from satellite imagery. The regionally mapped ES values correlated strongly with independent and local measures of ES. For example, regional estimates of the vegetation carbon stocks are strongly correlated with actual measures derived from field samples and validation data (significant anova test - p-value=4.51(e-9)) and differed on average by only 20Mg/ha from the field data. Our spatially-nested approach provides reliable and accurate maps of ES at both local and regional scales. Local maps account for the specificities of an area while regional maps provide an accurate generalization of an ES' state. Such up-scaling methods infuse large-scale ES maps with localized data and enable the estimation of uncertainty of at regional scales.

The richer the genetic baggage, the higher shall be the capacity to fight different fungi, virus, or bacteria. Like other essentials, rubber is an industrial commodity that is indispensable to humans with more than 55,000 vivid products made from it. Hevea, rubber originated in Amazon, where 1652 plants belonging to 107 species in 37 different families are found in about 630 m(2). Hevea-rubber originated in such a biologically diversified environment. From the story of the first transfer of rubber seeds from Brazil to Asia, it is difficult to evaluate how narrow the genetic base initially was for what has now become the Wickham domesticated population. Much importance was conferred to a small number of 22 seedlings disseminated from Singapore to Malaysia after 1876, and the original Wickham stock was collected in only one Brazilian site, Boim, on the Western banks of the Tapajoz River. Though generation wise assortative mating as the prime breeding tool was applied to these accessions and Wickham collection, much genetic variation could not be tapped for commercial purpose. The molecular marker systems (all three generations markers) are being applied in Hevea rubber. Of these, SNPs are the new generation markers used for Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS). A saturated linkage map of Hevea brasiliensis has been accomplished and the whole genome size was calculated as 6 x 10(8) base pairs. Selection was indirectly toward nuclear DNA polymorphism, while evolving modern clones. mtDNA of Wickham clones has lesser variation because their female progenitors are all primary clones (either PB 56 or Tjir 1). Chloroplast genomes are sufficiently large and complex to include structural and point mutations that are useful for evolutionary studies from intraspecific to interspecific levels. Populations were subjected to several rounds of controlled crossing that further narrowed the diversity. But the strategy followed by the breeders to select only the desirable genotypes and to reject the unwanted ones (without assessing the utility other than yield) is the main reason that reduced diversity. Much work at the molecular level had been carried out like for Tapping Panel Dryness, latex production, defense genes and alike. Setting up of a molecular library for Hevea and scientists working worldwide contributing to this library will be a good option to study and document molecular diversity.","[Priyadarshan, P.

In Mato Grosso, where diversified agriculture is a marginal presence in an industrialized agricultural landscape, none of the communities were achieving participant-defined threshold levels of any measured indicator of resilience. However, farmers who were members of a marketing cooperative selling produce through a federal public procurement program had significantly greater agrobiodiversity, plant-available soil phosphorus, household food self-sufficiency, and access to stable markets.

The question of who is entitled to land and under what conditions is at the heart of most debates concerning the region's future, but recent attempts to reform and simplify rural land tenure in Amazonia confront a history of contradictory land-use policies and a legacy of impunity. In response to economic and demographic pressures, the Brazilian state aims to combat the illicit occupation, sale, and transformation of lands. This article presents an ethnographic approach to the land question in Amazonia by studying the knowledge-making practices associated with the Programa Terra Legal (Legal Land Program), Brazil's effort to create a cadastral registry for rural holdings in the region. It argues that tenure regularization dedicated to securing smallholders' rights and to instituting environmental regulations is being used by rural elites as a mechanism to accumulate land and power. By showing how a reform program gets remade in the thrall of local interests and vernacular dispositions of property, this article reveals how knowledge both illuminates and obscures subjects of governance.","Roger Williams Univ, Bristol, RI 02809 USA",,"Campbell, JM (corresponding author), Roger Williams Univ, Bristol, RI 02809 USA.",,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2015.0,38.0,1,,,,147,167,,10.1111/plar.12091,,,,,,,,WOS:000353997100010,

Specifically, we estimate causal effects on tree cover change from the year of certification to 2012 using SCM and open-access, pan-tropical datasets. We demonstrate that it is possible to construct synthetic controls, or weighted combinations of non-certified FMUs, that followed the same path of tree cover change as the certified FMUs before certification. By using these synthetic controls to measure counterfactual tree cover change after certification, we find that certification reduced tree cover loss in the most recent year (2012) in all three landscapes. However, placebo tests show that in one case, this effect was not significant, and in another case, it followed several years in which certification had the opposite effect (increasing tree cover loss).

Here, we create a land use and land cover (LULC) time series for part of tropical Mato Grosso, Brazil, using the Bayesian Updating of Land Cover: Unsupervised (BULC-U) technique. The algorithm built backward in time from the GlobCover 2009 data set, a multi-category global LULC data set at 300 m resolution for the year 2009, combining it with Landsat time series imagery to create a land cover time series for the period 1986-2000. Despite the substantial LULC differences between the 1990s and 2009 in this area, much of the landscape remained the same: we asked whether we could harness those similarities and differences to recreate an accurate version of the earlier LULC. The GlobCover basis and the Landsat-5 images shared neither a common spatial resolution nor time frame, But BULC-U successfully combined the labels from the coarser classification with the spatial detail of Landsat. The result was an accurate fine-scale time series that quantified the expansion of deforestation in the study area, which more than doubled in size during this time. Earth Engine directly enabled the fusion of these different data sets held in its catalog: its flexible treatment of spatial resolution, rapid prototyping, and overall processing speed permitted the development and testing of this study. Many would-be users of remote sensing data are currently limited by the need to have highly specialized knowledge to create classifications of older data. The approach shown here presents fewer obstacles to participation and allows a wide audience to create their own time series of past decades. By leveraging both the varied data catalog and the processing speed of Earth Engine, this research can contribute to the rapid advances underway in multi-temporal image classification techniques.

We introduce a new class of multivariate mixed membership models that, when variables can be partitioned into subject-matter based domains, can provide a good fit to the data using fewer profiles than standard formulations. The proposed model explicitly accounts for the blocks of variables corresponding to the distinct domains along with a cross-domain correlation structure which provides new information about shared membership of individuals in a complex classification scheme. We specify a multivariate logistic normal distribution for the membership vectors which allows easy introduction of auxiliary information leveraging a latent multivariate logistic regression. A Bayesian approach to inference, relying on Polya gamma data augmentation, facilitates efficient posterior computation via Markov chain Monte Carlo.

We study the effectiveness of three regulatory policies implemented by Brazil in reducing this pressure: blacklisting of municipalities, the Soy Moratorium, and conservation zones. We use a triple difference approach that combines international agricultural commodity prices with the policies across three million km(2) in the Brazilian Amazon. We find that the blacklisting programis effective, as it reduces deforestation related to the prices by 40%. The Soy Moratorium made deforestation in exposed municipalities more sensitive to non-soy prices, in line with crop substitution. Conservation zones amplify the effect of prices on deforestation on the remaining unprotected land, consistent with reduced land supply. Our results highlight that the effect of environmental regulation depends on the economic pressure to use natural resources. (C) 2021 The Authors.

This resource utilization can differ between fish life stages, and individuals can migrate between habitats in search of resources. Such lifetime information is difficult to obtain due to the large spatial and temporal scales of fish behavior. The otolith organic matrix has the potential to indicate this resource utilization and migration with C-13 values of essential amino acids (EAAs), which are a direct indication of the primary producers. In a proof-of-concept study, we selected the Acoupa weakfish, Cynoscion acoupa, as a model fish species with distinct ontogenetic migration patterns. While it inhabits the Brazilian mangrove estuaries during juvenile stages, it moves to the coastal shelf as an adult. Thus, we expected that lifetime resource utilization and migration would be reflected in C-13(EAA) patterns and baseline values in C.acoupa otoliths. By analyzing the C.acoupa otolith edges across a size range of 12-119cm, we found that baseline C-13(EAA) values increased with size, which indicated an estuarine to coastal shelf distribution. This trend is highly correlated with inorganic C-13 values. The C-13(EAA) patterns showed that estuarine algae rather than mangrove-derived resources supported the juvenile C.acoupa populations. Around the juvenile size of 40cm, resource utilization overlapped with those of adults and mean baseline C-13(EAA) values increased. This trend was confirmed by comparing otolith core and edges, although with some individuals potentially migrating over longer distances than others. Hence, C-13(EAA) patterns and baseline values in otoliths have great potential to reconstruct ontogenetic shifts in resource use and habitats. The insight could aid in predictions on how environmental changes affect fish populations by identifying the controlling factors at the base of the food web.","[Vane, Kim; Ekau, Werner] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Bremen, Germany; [Larsen, Thomas] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Leibniz Lab Radiometr Dating & Stable Isotope Res, Kiel, Germany; [Scholz-Boettcher, Barbara M.; Kopke, Bernd] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Oldenburg, Germany; [Vane, Kim] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany",,"Vane, K (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Bremen, Germany.; Vane, K (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany.",kim.vane@leibniz-zmt.de,,,,,,,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2018.0,8.0,19,,,,9859,9869,,10.1002/ece3.4471,,,,,,,,WOS:000448803000025,

In the Brazilian Amazon the effects of this process are seen in the ongoing deforestation and land-use change (about 65% of deforestation can be linked to cattle ranching). One of the main causes of this trend is the increased efficiency of the transport infrastructure: along both sides of the Brazilian Inter-Oceanic highway, about 50km of rainforest have been converted to cattle ranching. In 2011 the Inter-Oceanic highway was finalized also on the Peruvian side: the region of Madre de Dios is neighboring the Brazilian Amazon, therefore the risk is that this area will undergo the same kind of development. The objective of this analysis is to highlight the contribution of global meat demand trend as cause of land use change and deforestation in the Madre de Dios region. This focus has been chosen since, nowadays, the magnitude of cattle ranching activities is hidden by more evident and damaging activities (e.g., gold mining), and its near-future effects risk to be underestimated. By starting with investigating the preliminary signals of cattle ranching contribution to the local deforestation process, this analysis will serve as basis for more comprehensive future works on local data, including monitoring campaigns of local biodiversity and GHG emissions. Land-use change is, thus, analyzed through FAO data and also through data acquired with remote sensing carried out within other projects. Meat consumption and production outcomes are obtained from the FAOSTAT database. By integrating trends in the regional meat consumption with the emerging trading effects, which are incremented by the new highway, it is possible to highlight the risk that the global convergence in meat consumption trends can locally influence the deforestation in Madre de Dios.

Currently, there is concern about the effects of human-made environmental changes on the transmission of leishmaniasis due to increased exposure to the sand fly vector. In this paper, the authors explored changes in the distribution of sand flies and natural leishmania infection across communities located along the interoceanic highway that connects Peru and Brazil. The study found differences in sand fly species composition and abundance between and within sites as well as a lower sand fly diversity in communities with high human disturbance. Ten pools belonging to Lutzomyia shawi, Lu. carrerai carrerai, Lu. yuilli yuilli, Lu. hirsuta hirsuta, Lu. (Helcocyrtomyia) spp. and Lu. (Lutzomyia) spp. were found positive for Leishmania spp. The majority of these positive pools were collected from a single community and far from the highway. The information provided by this manuscript will serve as a baseline to assess the effects of human activities in the region and guide future surveillance and intervention strategies. The Peruvian-Brazilian border is a highly endemic tegumentary leishmaniasis region in South America. The interoceanic highway is a commercial route that connects Peru and Brazil through Madre de Dios and has raised concerns about its impact on previously undisturbed areas. In order to assess leishmaniasis transmission risk along this highway, we conducted a surveillance study of the sand fly populations in this area. Sand flies were collected between 2009 and 2010 along transects at 200 m, 600 m and 1000 m from six study sites located along the highway (Iberia, La Novia, Alto Libertad, El Carmen, Florida Baja, Mazuko and Mavila) and an undisturbed area (Malinowski). Collected specimens were identified based on morphology and non-engorged females of each species were pooled and screened by kinetoplast PCR to detect natural Leishmania infections. A total of 9,023 specimens were collected belonging to 54 different Lutzomyia species including the first report of Lu. gantieri in Peru. Four species accounted for 50% of all specimens (Lutzomyia carrerai carrerai, Lu. davisi, Lu. shawi and Lu. richardwardi). El Carmen, Alto Libertad, Florida Baja and Malinowski presented higher Shannon diversity indexes (H = 2.36, 2.30, 2.17 and 2.13, respectively) than the most human disturbed sites of Mazuko and La Novia (H = 1.53 and 1.06, respectively). PCR detected 10 positive pools belonging to Lu. carrerai carrerai, Lu. yuilli yuilli, Lu. hirsuta hirsuta, Lu. (Trichophoromyia) spp., and Lu. (Lutzomyia) spp. Positive pools from 1,000 m transects had higher infectivity rates than those from 600 m and 200 m transects (9/169 = 5.3% vs 0/79 = 0% and 1/127 = 0.8%, p = 0.018). El Carmen, accounted for eight out of ten positives whereas one positive was collected in Florida Baja and Mazuko each. Our study has shown differences in sand fly diversity, abundance and species composition across and within sites. Multiple clustered Lutzomyia pools with natural Leishmania infection suggest a complex, diverse and spotty role in leishmaniasis transmission in Madre de Dios, with increased risk farther from the highway.","[Valdivia, Hugo O.; Perez, Jocelyn G.] US Naval Med Res Unit 6, Dept Parasitol, Lima, Peru; [Zorrilla, Victor O.; Espada, Liz J.; Fernandez, Roberto; Tong, Carlos; Vasquez, Gissella M.; Burrus, Roxanne G.] US Naval Med Res Unit 6, Dept Entomol, Lima, Peru; [Razuri, Hugo R.; Ghersi, Bruno M.; Montgomery, Joel M.] US Naval Med Res Unit 6, Dept Emerging Infect, Lima, Peru; [Vera, Hubert] Direcc Reg Salud Madre Dios, Puerto Maldonado, Peru; [Lescano, Andres G.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Emerge Emerging Dis & Climate Change Res Unit, Lima, Peru; [Lescano, Andres G.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Clime Latin Amer Ctr Excellence Climate Change &, Lima, Peru",,"Valdivia, HO (corresponding author), US Naval Med Res Unit 6, Dept Parasitol, Lima, Peru.",hugo.o.valdivia.ln@mail.mil,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021.0,15.0,2,,,,,,e0009000,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009000,,,,,,,,WOS:000618282100005,

However, demonstration of policy impacts in agricultural settings has been hampered by the lack of systematic analysis across landholders, who may not universally adopt government policy incentives, or time periods, which may be associated with differing policy regimes. This paper evaluates the importance of voluntary adoption of policy incentives offered by Peruvian government administrations over two decades for land-use among small farmers in the Peruvian Amazon. The analysis focuses on whether farmers adopted one or more policy incentives in order to observe the effects on land uses including mature forest, agricultural crops, cattle pasture, and secondary growth. We employ multivariate statistical models to estimate the effects of policy adoption while controlling for other factors. The findings show that distinct policies are associated with particular land-uses and largely follow expectations. Specifying policy incentives promulgated by governments and differentiating among adopters and non-adopters advances understanding of the impacts of public policies on land use.","[Birgit Chavez, Andrea] Univ Nacl Amazon Madre de Dios, Puerto Maldonado, Madre De Dios, Peru; [Perz, Stephen G.] Univ Florida, Dept Sociol & Criminol & Law, Gainesville, FL USA",,"Chavez, AB (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Amazon Madre de Dios, Puerto Maldonado, Madre De Dios, Peru.",achavez@ufl.edu,,,,,,,18,18,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2012.0,40.0,4,,,,525,539,,10.1007/s10745-012-9494-3,,,,,,,,WOS:000307252200003,

Here we leverage our large property-level supply chain database that links together six years of records from the Animal Transport Guide (GTA), high-resolution satellite data, property boundaries, and land cover data to quantify different types of supply chain connections and characterize cattle production in Mato Grosso. We find that a relatively small number of high-volume suppliers-defined as the top 5% of cattle suppliers in terms of the volume of cattle sold-supplied 50-60% of the total volume purchased by major slaughterhouses. One-fourth of high-volume direct suppliers cleared forest between 2009-2018, and 90% of them also bought from indirect suppliers with deforestation, leading these high-volume direct suppliers to act as funnels for deforestation into the supply chain.

Disturbed habitats in Amazonia, like active pastures and abandoned agricultural areas, are characterized by significant diurnal and seasonal drought stress that may restrict successful colonization by many plant taxa. Some species, however, show a remarkable capacity to withstand these water-limited conditions. We investigated, under controlled conditions, the bulk tissue-water relations and the gas-exchange characteristics in response to soil moisture stress of Solanum crinitum Lam. and Vismia guianensis (Aubl.) Choisy, two co-occurring gap-invading small trees known to dominate, disturbed, drought-prone habitats in the eastern Brazilian Amazon region. 2. Bulk tissue-water relations of these two species were very different. Vismia guianensis had significantly higher bulk tissue elastic modulus (more rigid tissues) and lower bulk tissue osmotic potential at full hydration and at turgor loss than S. crinitum. 3. The elastic and osmotic properties could either enhance turgor maintenance or increase the ability of a plant to extract soil water. In turn, this may help explain their ability to succeed in drought-prone habitats. With more elastic tissue properties, S. crinitum is able to maintain turgor and thus leaf gas exchange over greater changes in tissue water content, whereas having relatively more rigid tissues would aid V. guianensis in developing water potential gradients from the leaves to the soil with little tissue water loss, thus enhancing water uptake from drier soils. 4. Photosynthetic capacity in S. crinitum was less affected by soil moisture stress than V. guianensis. Furthermore, because S. crinitum maintained stomatal conductance (g), but photosynthesis (A) declined under moisture stress, intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/g) actually dropped when water was limiting for this species. In contrast, V. guianensis maintained high A/g under both watering regimes and was always more water-use efficient than S. crinitum. Moreover, S. crinitum had two- to fourfold higher dark respiration than V. guianensis. We believe that it is this combination of traits that leads to lower growth in S. crinitum when compared to V. guianensis in the field. 5. We suggest that the different gas-exchange responses and tissue water relations properties represent two different strategies for dealing with water deficits. Solanum crinitum, appears to be more able to cope with short-term water stress and is regarded to be a successful stress tolerator. In contrast, V. guianesis, appears to be able to cope better with chronic, long-term water stress, what we call a successful stress-avoider.","CORNELL UNIV, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA",,"DIASFILHO, MB (corresponding author), CPATU, EMBRAPA, C POSTAL 48, BR-66095 BELEM, PARA, BRAZIL.",,,,,,,,10,12,,,,,,,,,,,APR,1995.0,9.0,2,,,,213,221,,10.2307/2390567,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QU91300010,

These areas of growth have led to the deforestation of tropical forests, a process that contributes negatively to climate change, and a decline in the provision of environmental services and biodiversity. This article seeks to propose and simulate a theoretical model of optimal control at the household level. This model is used to explain the dynamics of forest loss by expansion of the agricultural frontier. Under these conditions, based on tradable permanent crops, farmers decide whether to install new areas for cultivation or manage existing ones in a context of increasing transportation costs. We simulate a theoretical model using data on permanent crops in the high forest of Peru. The results of the model establish that there is a limit to the expansion of the agricultural frontier of the rainforest due to transportation costs. This limit can be surpassed in the context of the free movement of labor whenever these costs cause a decrease and/or increase in the price of land cultivation. Finally, the main policy recommendations of this study emphasize the subordination of transport policy to agroforestry and the conservation of forest ecosystems policies. Agroforestry design forest policies should consider the differential impact of the construction of highways and rural roads on the loss of tree cover as well as on sustainable food production, given that deforestation is not accelerated by the mere existence of roads but by the incentives that are presented to settlers to guide their efforts toward clearing new forest areas.","[Lucich, Ivan M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Lima 32, Peru; [Villena, Mauricio G.; Jose Quinteros, Maria] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Negocios, Santiago, Chile",,"Villena, MG (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Negocios, Ave Diagonal Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile.",mauricio.villena@uai.cl,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY-AUG,2015.0,42.0,2,,,,153,169,,10.4067/S0718-16202015000200003,,,,,,,,WOS:000367317000003,

I use longitudinal, semi-structured interview data to study forced migration among farmers displaced by the Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian Amazon. Results from baseline interviews indicate that nearly all community members aspired to purchase rural land in the region and maintain livelihoods as cacao farmers or cattle ranchers. Constraints limiting the ability to attain aspirations included strict requirements on land titles for properties, delays in receiving compensation, rising land prices, and the lack of power to negotiate for better compensation. Despite these constraints, most migrants succeeded in attaining aspirations, as they were able to mobilize resources such as social networks, financial capital, skills, and knowledge. These findings highlight the importance of considering the relationship between structure and agency within forced migration research. I conclude by discussing how the findings may inform resettlement policies for future cases of development- or environment-induced forced migration.","[Randell, Heather] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Populat Studies & Training Ctr, Dept Sociol, Box 1916,Maxcy Hall,108 George St, Providence, RI 02912 USA",,"Randell, H (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Populat Studies & Training Ctr, Dept Sociol, Box 1916,Maxcy Hall,108 George St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",heather_randell@brown.edu,,,,,,,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2016.0,37.0,3,,,,265,287,,10.1007/s11111-015-0245-4,,,,,,,,WOS:000370367900001,

These forest fragments suffer from edge effects, which cause changes in ecological and ecosystem processes, undermining habitat quality and the offer of ecosystem services. Even though detailed and long term studies were developed on the topic of edge effects at local scale, understanding edge effect characteristics in fragmented forests on larger scales and finding indicators for its impact is crucial for predicting habitat loss and developing management options. Here we evaluate the spatial and temporal dimensions of edge effects in large areas using remote sensing. First we executed a neighborhood pixel analysis in 11 LANDSAT Tree Cover (LTC) scenes (180 x 185 km each, 8 in the tropics and 3 in temperate forested areas) using tree cover as an indicator of habitat quality and in relation to edge distance. Second, we executed a temporal analysis of LTC in a smaller area in the Brazilian Amazon forest where one larger forest fragment (25,890 ha) became completely fragmented in 5 years. Our results show that for all 11 scenes pixel neighborhood variation of LTC is much higher in the vicinity of forest edges, becoming lower towards the forest interior. This analysis suggests a maximum distance for edge effects and can indicate the location of unaffected core areas. However, LTC patterns in relation to fragment edge distance vary according to the analyzed region, and maximum edge distance may differ according to local conditions. Our temporal analysis illustrates the change in tree cover patterns after 5 years of fragmentation, becoming on average lower close to the edge (between 50 and 100 m). Although it is still unclear which are the main causes of LTC edge variability within and between regions, LANDSAT Tree Cover could be used as an accessible and efficient discriminator of edge and interior forest habitats in fragmented landscapes, and become invaluable for deriving qualitative spatial and temporal information of ecological and ecosystem processes.

Although tree-based agroecosystems may cycle nutrients more efficiently than other agricultural systems, difficulties maintaining phosphorus (P) availability to plants growing in tropical Ultisols and Oxisols may threaten the long-term sustainability of Amazonian agroforests. To determine how soil nutrient dynamics are altered when primary forest is converted to perennial crops, soils from eight 6-year-old peach palm (Bactris gusipaes Kunth)-cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflora) plantation agroforests were compared to those of adjacent native forests in Acre, Brazil. The response of fine roots to P microsite enrichment by agroforest and native forest plants on eight farms was measured using a root ingrowth bioassay to determine if a P-limitation already threatened agroforest sustainability. Localized root proliferation by individual agroforest species was also examined as a component of interspecific competition. The impact of agroforest adoption by small farmers on forest clearing was qualitatively examined through interviews and focus groups held with farmers participating in the field studies. Six years after establishment on sites initially occupied by native terra firme forest, exchangeable base cations, ECEC and pH were greater in agroforest soils than in those of adjacent forests. Extractable inorganic P was 30-50% lower in agroforest soil, suggesting that P uptake by the aggrading agroecosystem outpaced its restoration in the soil solution by other P pools. After 100 days, cupuassu root length and mass were greater in P-treated cores buried in agroforest alleys, but not in cores buried in rows. 'While a P deficiency in any of the agroforest components could not be inferred using the root ingrowth technique, the study of root proliferation demonstrated both the potential for interspecific competition among peach palm and other agroforest components. as well as opportunities for alleviating the impact of competition through management practices. Discussions with farmers revealed that this type of commercial plantation agroforest, unless managed to maintain productivity, may actually contribute to more forest clearing on small farms because of a lack of farmer confidence in the future of the system. Thus, despite more efficient nutrient cycling in tree-based agroecosystems, the decline in agroforest soil P following establishment must be addressed through management practices if plantation agroforests are to remain a sustainable land use in Amazonia.

We studied the structure and economy of the mahogany companies operating in southern Para State, the major mahogany processing center in the Brazilian Amazon. Of the 86 mills in operation in this region, 24 specialized in mahogany and were responsible for processing 90% of the mahogany harvest. Many of these mahogany mills (60%) were established in the 1980s. By the early 1990s, most (98%) were vertically integrated-participating in forest logging, log transport, mill processing, and marketing. Mahogany companies achieved good profits in the early 1990s. A typical mill with one band saw produced, on average, 4500 m(3) of sawn wood year(-1) from 9900 m(3) of roundwood. The value of this sawn wood was approximately $3 000 000; annual profits for such a company were approximately $800 000. In three logging operations that we studied, an average of 5 m(3) of mahogany logs were extracted per hectare; this is equivalent to the extraction of about one mahogany tree per hectare. However, future cuts of mahogany are in doubt: in surveys of recently logged sites we encountered, on average, only 0.25 mahogany trees of at least 30 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) per hectare and no trees between 10 and 30 cm dbh. Mahogany seedlings were also rare. Logging damage can be great on a local scale. Thirty-one trees at least 10 cm dbh were severely damaged for each mahogany tree harvested; approximately 1100 m(2) of forest ground surface were scraped clean or trampled for each mahogany tree removed. However, because mahogany trees are usually distributed in widely scattered patches only a small fraction of the region's forest has been directly disturbed by this logging. Nonetheless, the specific effect on Swietenia macrophylla-its population numbers and genetic structure-may be significant. Moreover, mahogany logging indirectly contributes to regional deforestation. Logging companies have opened up some 3000 km of logging roads in southern Para and mahogany logging has been documented in each of the region's 15 Indian Reserves. After logging, there is a growing trend to convert forests to cattle pasture, in part perhaps, because the prospects for future mahogany harvests do not appear to be good.

The paper introduces the conceptual space where quantity and allocation are involved in predicting carbon emissions, and then uses the concepts to predict carbon emissions in the Brazilian Amazon, using previously published information about carbon mapping and deforestation modelling. Results showed that variation in quantity of carbon among carbon maps was the most influential component of uncertainty, followed by quantity of predicted deforestation. Spatial allocation of carbon within carbon maps was less influential than quantity of carbon in the maps. For most of the carbon maps, spatial allocation of deforestation had a minor but variable effect on the prediction of carbon emissions relative to the other components. The influence of spatial carbon allocation reaches its maximum when 50% of the initial forest area is deforested. The method can be applied to other case studies to evaluate the interacting effects of quantity and allocation of carbon with future deforestation on the prediction of carbon emissions from deforestation.","[Hugo Gutierrez-Velez, Victor] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pontius, Robert Gilmore, Jr.] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Hugo Gutierrez-Velez, Victor] Res Ctr Ecosyst & Global Change Carbon & Bosques, Medellin, Colombia",,"Gutierrez-Velez, VH (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, 10th Floor Schermerhorn,1200 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",vhg2103@columbia.edu,,,,,,,10,11,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2012.0,39.0,4,,,,325,336,,10.1017/S0376892912000173,,,,,,,,WOS:000310464900003,

Bedrock units exclusively encompassing sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks, or metamorphic rocks cover 40.4%, 31.5%, and 17.7%, respectively, of the total bedrock area. These numbers have to be considered minimum estimates of the areal abundance of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic bedrock because polygons defined by mixed lithologies cover similar to 8.5-9.5% of the total bedrock area. These mixed units are sedimentary rocks with igneous and/or metamorphic contributions (1.4%), metamorphic rocks with sedimentary contributions (1.2%), metamorphic rocks with igneous contributions (1.5%), igneous rocks with sedimentary and/or metamorphic contributions (4.4%), and ultramafic units with sedimentary, igneous, and/or metamorphic contributions (similar to 1-2%). The average ages of major lithologic units, weighted according to bedrock area, are as follows: sedimentary rocks (average stratigraphic age of 248 +/- 5 [1 sigma] Myr; median stratigraphic age of 87.5 Myr), igneous rocks (1153 +/- 13 [1 sigma] Myr), metamorphic rocks (1678 +/- 30 [1 sigma] Myr), and ultramafic rocks (similar to 1227 +/- 25 [1 sigma] Myr).

We pursue this explication via direct physical immersion, in the form of a travelogue following State Road PA-150 from Maraba to Eldorado dos Carajas, the scene of a massacre of nineteen land reform activists, shot down by Brazilian military police in collusion with the landed elite in 1996. Along the way, we have occasion to encounter the land reform movements and the forces of repression, which we depict both descriptively and theoretically, using our field trip as a point of departure for philosophical elaboration. To this end, we activate Artaud's Theater of Cruelty to disclose the nature of violent conflict in the region. We suggest that theater, more generally, provides structure for cruel performance, and that violent land conflict, together with forest destruction, constitutes a predictable tragedy of theatrical events. In other words, violent land conflict in Amazonia, with all its terrible implications for people and environment, can be grasped as a theatrical structure, with philosophic and material consequences for mind and body. Thus, we articulate the development discourse of Amazonia as a violent, existential game, not a narrative of disembodied forces.","[Walker, Robert; Simmons, Cynthia] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Aldrich, Stephen] Indiana State Univ, Dept Geog, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Perz, Stephen] Univ Florida, Dept Sociol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Arima, Eugenio] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geog & Environm, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Caldas, Marcellus] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",,"Walker, R (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",rwalker@msu.edu; simmol08@msu.edu; Stephen.Aldrich@indstate.edu; sperz@ufl.edu; arima@hwu.edu; caldasma@k-state.edu,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,101.0,5,,,,1156,1170,,10.1080/00045608.2011.579539,,,,,,,,WOS:000299282400011,

Revisiting medicinal and religious plants at an Amazonian market,JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Background In spite of an increasing number of ethnobotanical market surveys in the past decades, few studies compare changes in plant species trade over time. The open-air market Ver-o-Peso (VOP) in Belem, located near the mouth of the Amazon River in the state of Para, Brazil, is known for its wide variety of medicinal plants. A survey of VOP was published in 1984, but it remains unknown to what extent its botanical composition changed over 34 years. Furthermore, in northern Brazil, little attention has been given to the origins of the vernacular names of these plants. Our aim is to give an up-to-date overview of the VOP medicinal plant market, concentrating on changes in species composition and vernacular names over time. Methods We collected medicinal plants and vernacular names at VOP in August 2018. We identified most plants at the Museo Paraense Emilio Goeldi Herbarium, where we also deposited vouchers and specimen labels. We compared our species composition data to the 1984 inventory by Van den Berg. Furthermore, we investigated the etymologies of the vernacular plant names. Results We recorded 155 plant specimens and 165 corresponding vernacular names, and collected 146 specimens from the medicinal and ritual stalls of VOP reporting 86 species formerly not recorded at this market. Vernacular names had mostly Portuguese roots, followed by Tupi and African ones. We found 30 species also documented in 1984, and vernacular names that overlapped between both surveys were used for the same botanical species or genus, indicating that vernacular names have changed little in the past decades. Lastly, we found 26 more introduced species sold at VOP compared to 1984. Conclusions Forest degradation and deforestation, prevalence of diseases, and methodological factors may play a role in the differences we found in our survey compared to 1984. Of the plants that did overlap between the two surveys, vernacular names of these plants were hardly different. Lastly, the lingual origins of the vernacular names in our survey and the origins of the plant species reflect the history of the intricate syncretism of medicinal plant practices of indigenous, Afro-Brazilian and European origins in Belem.","[Geertsma, Isabela Pombo] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Francozo, Mariana; Rodriguez, Mireia Alcantara] Leiden Univ, Fac Archaeol, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands; [Francozo, Mariana] Leiden Univ, Fac Archaeol, PI ERC BRASILIAE Project, Leiden, Netherlands; [van Andel, Tinde] Leiden Univ, IBL, Clusius Chair Hist Bot & Gardens, Leiden, Netherlands; [van Andel, Tinde] Nat Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [van Andel, Tinde] Wageningen Univ, Biosystemat Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",,"Geertsma, IP (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",tinde.vanandel@naturalis.nl,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 5,2021.0,17,1,,,,,,9,10.1186/s13002-021-00433-4,,,,,,,,WOS:000617444600002,

Here we examined different ways to use land surface temperature (LST) to detect changes in tropical forest cover. In our analysis we used monthly 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations of LST and Program for the Estimation of Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon (PRODES) estimates of forest cover change. We also compared MODIS LST observations with an independent estimate of forest cover loss derived from MODIS and Landsat observations. Our study domain of approximately 10 degrees x 10 degrees included the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. For optimal use of LST data to detect changes in tropical forest cover in our study area, we found that using data sampled during the end of the dry season (similar to 1-2 months after minimum monthly precipitation) had the greatest predictive skill. During this part of the year, precipitation was low, surface humidity was at a minimum, and the difference between day and night LST was the largest. We used this information to develop a simple temporal sampling algorithm appropriate for use in pantropical deforestation classifiers. Combined with the normalized difference vegetation index, a logistic regression model using day-night LST did moderately well at predicting forest cover change. Annual changes in day-night LST decreased during 2006-2009 relative to 2001-2005 in many regions within the Amazon, providing independent confirmation of lower deforestation levels during the latter part of this decade as reported by PRODES.","[van Leeuwen, Thijs T.; van der Werf, Guido R.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Hydrol & Geoenvironm Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Frank, Andrew J.; Smyth, Padhraic] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [van Leeuwen, Thijs T.; Jin, Yufang; Goulden, Michael L.; Randerson, James T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"van Leeuwen, TT (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Hydrol & Geoenvironm Sci, Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",thijs.van.leeuwen@falw.vu.nl; ajfrank@ics.uci.edu; yufang@uci.edu; smyth@ics.uci.edu; mgoulden@uci.edu; guido.van.der.werf@falw.vu.nl; jranders@uci.edu,,,,,,,28,28,,,,,,,,,,,APR 15,2011.0,116,,,,,,,G02002,10.1029/2010JG001488,,,,,,,,WOS:000289648300003,

This paper examines the history and causes of the recent rapid deforestation of a lowland karst region of the Dominican Republic in the light of models derived from studies in Central America and the Amazon. Investigation was limited to the vicinity of a single village (Los Limones). Information was drawn from interviews, questionnaires and ground reconnaissance, in addition to archival information and aerial photographs. Deforestation at Los Limones involved many of the same elements seen in mainland deforestation, including construction of access roads, spontaneous agricultural colonization, and pasture conversion, but it followed no single mainland model. Logging, not normally emphasized as a cause of Latin American deforestation, played an important role in opening up the forest to agricultural settlement. Pasture conversion was not a matter of aggregation of large ranches by wealthy absentee landowners, as in the Amazon, but apparently a local response to the economic and ecological advantages of cattle raising. Government actions strongly influenced deforestation, but not via colonization schemes or economic subsidies for cattle ranching; the rhythm of deforestation at Los Limones was tied to the monopolistic practices of the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo and the social disorganization following his assassination. The national government in fact bears the primary responsibility for deforestation of Los Haitises, a conclusion that contradicts the government's own suggestion that the destruction was largely carried out by poor farmers. Prospects for rehabilitation of the deforested area are gloomy because of the extent of ecological damage and the continued adversarial relationship between the government and the rural population.","Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Geog, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",,"Brothers, TS (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Geog, 425 Univ Blvd, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",,,,,,,,10,11,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,1997.0,24,3,,,,213,223,,10.1017/S0376892997000301,,,,,,,,WOS:000071117100004,

Both species are commercially harvested for timber and non-timber products which can fetch high prices on national and international markets.

In the logged forests, there was a lower density of very large D. odorata trees, while the areas used for D. odorata seed extraction showed a drastic reduction in the frequency of young trees.

The forests account for about 10 per cent of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and for a similar fraction of the carbon stored in land ecosystems(2,3), and short-term held measurements' suggest that these ecosystems are globally important carbon sinks. But tropical land ecosystems have experienced substantial interannual climate variability owing to frequent El Nino episodes in recent decades(5). Of particular importance to climate change policy is how such climate variations, coupled with increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration, affect terrestrial carbon storage(6-8). Previous model analyses have demonstrated the importance of temperature in controlling carbon storage(9,10). Here we use a transient process-based biogeochemical model of terrestrial ecosystems(3,11) to investigate interannual variations of carbon storage in undisturbed Amazonian ecosystems in response to climate variability and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration during the period 1980 to 1994. In El Nino years, which bring hot, dry weather to much of the Amazon region, the ecosystems act as a source of carbon to the atmosphere (up to 0.2 petagrams of carbon in 1987 and 1992). In other years, these ecosystems act as a carbon sink (up to 0.7 Pg C in 1981 and 1993). These fluxes are large; they compare to a 0.3 Pg C per year source to the atmosphere associated with deforestation in the Amazon Basin in the early 1990s(12). Soil moisture, which is affected by both precipitation and temperature, and which affects both plant and soil processes, appears to be an important central on carbon storage.","Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ Alaska, Alaska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA",,"Tian, HQ (corresponding author), Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",,,,,,,,319,376,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 17,1998.0,396,6712,,,,664,667,,10.1038/25328,,,,,,,,WOS:000077694200050,

The malarial gaze was a type of enduring, inactive, and embodied gaze that he imagines as a mode of resistance against capitalist modernity - a trope that finds its way into the critical discourse on national identity. Dialoguing with film theory and queer phenomenology, the article closely reads three scenes of looking in Andrade's Amazonian photographs and travel notes, in which such a perceptual state is evoked and unravels a processual entanglement between capitalist modernity, the Amazon, and the modernist subject. The article shows how the inactive malarial gaze emerges through a mediated queer experience of the filmic image that gets suppressed in favour of a pure immediacy of the tropics, arguing that at the core of Andrade's ambivalent politics of looking lies the problem of the impossibility of a critical national project. Fleshing out the political potentialities held by perception, the author suggests through Mario de Andrade a film-political constellation to understand the critical stakes of being an inactive spectator in the (geo)politics of extractive, peripheral capitalism.","[Kunigami, Andre Keiji] UC Irvine, Dept Film & Media Studies, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"Kunigami, AK (corresponding author), UC Irvine, Dept Film & Media Studies, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",akunigam@uci.edu,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 2,2020.0,29,3,,,,379,399,,10.1080/13569325.2020.1823347,,DEC 2020,,,,,,WOS:000597362300001,

Countries located in the Neotropical region, Central and South America, are aiming to understand the drivers of carbon stocks of their forests to build a better capacity for forest management. In this study, we calculated Above Ground Biomass - AGB stocks for 32 (1 ha) vegetation plots of forests classified as terra finite and seasonally flooded, and evaluated the effect of basin location, structural and environmental variables on the magnitude of AGB stocks. We report that variation among river basins results from the effects of fragmentation and soil fertility. The most important variable, determining the magnitude of AGB stocks in lowland forests in the region is the number of large trees per hectare. Seasonally flooded forests should be studied and managed separately from terra firme forests as these behave differently in the relationship between tree species diversity and AGB stocks. We found that the proportions of endozoochoric and synzoochoric tree species are important variables for the magnitude of AGB stocks in these forests. We present the first account on the drivers of AGB stocks in Northwestern South America and show that environmental characteristics of forests, such as flooding and fragmentation should be taken into account to determine the variation on AGB stocks among forests in this region.

This country, however, suffered from the highest deforestation rate surpassing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in 2012. National capacity for forest change assessment and monitoring has been well-established in Indonesia and the availability of national forest inventory data could largely assist the country to report their forest carbon stocks and change over more than two decades. This work focuses for refining forest cover change mapping and deforestation estimate at national scale applying over 10,000 scenes of Landsat scenes, acquired in 1990, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2012. Pre-processing of the data includes, geometric corrections and image mosaicking. The classification of mosaic Landsat data used multi-stage visual observation approaches, verified using ground observations and comparison with other published materials. There are 23 land cover classes identified from land cover data, presenting spatial information of forests, agriculture, plantations, non-vegetated lands and other land use categories. We estimated the magnitude of forest cover change and assessed drivers of forest cover change over time. Forest change trajectories analysis was also conducted to observe dynamics of forest cover across time. This study found that careful interpretations of satellite data can provide reliable information on forest cover and change. Deforestation trend in Indonesia was lower in 2000-2012 compared to 1990-2000 periods. We also found that over 50% of forests loss in 1990 remains unproductive in 2012. Major drivers of forest conversion in Indonesia range from shrubs/open land, subsistence agriculture, oil palm expansion, plantation forest and mining. The results were compared with other available datasets and we obtained that the MOF data yields reliable estimate of deforestation.","[Wijaya, A.; Murdiyarso, D.; Verchot, L.

This is a stark counterexample to the claims of Chomsky and others. The second lesson is that the influence of culture on Piraha grammar, coupled with much established and newer research, indicates that the idea of an innate, universal grammar has little if any role to play in our understanding of the nature, origins, and use of human language.

Third, these premises are exemplified and mirrored in three agroforestry-related case-studies: (1) slash-and-burn agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon, (2) socio-ecological management of coffee-agroforests in Ethiopia, and (3) afforestation with multipurpose tree species in Uzbekistan. The paper concludes by streamlining the theoretical and practical premises exposed with the presented case-studies, and confirming how these have guided ZEF in the planning, implementation and continuation of development research programs.

Some cases of resistance to chloroquine, the first-line treatment used against P. vivax malaria, have been described in the Brazilian Amazon region. The aim of this study is to investigate a possible dispersion of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax isolates in French Guiana. The genotype, polymorphism and copy number variation, of the P. vivax multidrug resistance gene-1 (pvmdr1) have been previously associated with modification of the susceptibility to chloroquine. Methods: The pvmdr1 gene polymorphism was evaluated by sequencing and copy number variation was assessed by real-time PCR, in P. vivax isolates obtained from 591 symptomatic patients from 1997 to 2013. Results: The results reveal that 1.0% [95% CI 0.4-2.2] of French Guiana isolates carry the mutations Y976F and F1076L, and that the proportion of isolates with multiple copies of pvmdr1 has significantly decreased over time, from 71.3% (OR = 6.2 [95% CI 62.9-78.7], p < 0.0001) in 1997-2004 to 12.8% (OR = 0.03 [95% CI 9.4-16.9], p < 0.0001) in 2009-2013. A statistically significant relationship was found between Guf-A (harboring the single mutation T958M) and Sal-1 (wild type) alleles and pvmdr1 copy number. Conclusions: Few P. vivax isolates harboring chloroquine-resistant mutations in the pvmdr1 gene are circulating in French Guiana. However, the decrease in the prevalence of isolates carrying multiple copies of pvmdr1 might indicate that the P. vivax population in French Guiana is evolving towards a decreased susceptibility to chloroquine.","[Faway, Emilie; Musset, Lise; Pelleau, Stephane; Volney, Beatrice; Casteras, Jessica; Briolant, Sebastien; Legrand, Eric] Inst Pasteur, Lab Parasitol, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Faway, Emilie] Univ Namur, URPhyM NARILIS, Namur, Belgium; [Musset, Lise; Pelleau, Stephane; Volney, Beatrice; Casteras, Jessica; Legrand, Eric] Inst Pasteur, Natl Reference Ctr Malaria, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Musset, Lise; Pelleau, Stephane; Volney, Beatrice; Legrand, Eric] Inst Pasteur, World Hlth Org, Collaborating Ctr Surveillance Antimalarial Drug, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Caro, Valerie] Inst Pasteur, Environm & Infect Risks Unit, Genotyping Pathogens Pole, Paris, France; [Menard, Didier] Inst Pasteur Cambodia, Malaria Mol Epidemiol Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Menard, Didier] Inst Pasteur Cambodia, Malaria Translat Res Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Briolant, Sebastien] Direct Interarmees Serv Sante, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Briolant, Sebastien] Inst Rech Biomed Armees, Bretigny Sur Orge, France; [Legrand, Eric] Inst Pasteur, Malaria Translat Res Unit, Paris, France; [Legrand, Eric] Inst Pasteur, Genet & Genom Insect Vectors Unit, Paris, France",,"Legrand, E (corresponding author), Inst Pasteur, Genet & Genom Insect Vectors Unit, Paris, France.",eric.legrand@pasteur.fr,,,,,,,12,13,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 8,2016.0,15,,,,,,,540,10.1186/s12936-016-1595-9,,,,,,,,WOS:000388144300005,

These representations often sexualized indigenous peoples and the Amazon itself, portraying them as primitive, cannibal savages, animals or part of nature, or victims of exploitation. The Othering of the Amazon and Amazonians was further elaborated through a discourse of binary oppositions that portrayed Western white men as explorers and exploiters who dominated the screen, scripts, studies, and development projects even if they were doomed to fail. By relying on a symbolic system of difference, global media coverage and films about Amazonia in the 1970s were complicit in legitimizing authoritarian decrees promoting large-scale development that depicted indigenous peoples and the environment as obstacles. Un analisis de las representaciones mediaticas de la Amazonia y sus pueblos indigenas revela como, en la decada de 1970, productores y cineastas mediaticos resaltaron discursos que naturalizaron las diferencias de genero y racializadas con las que se distinguian a la Amazonia del Occidente en una epoca durante la cual la dictadura militar brasilena promovio proyectos de desarrollo en la region. Dichas representaciones a menudo sexualizaban a los pueblos indigenas y a la Amazonia misma, retratandolos como primitivos, canibales salvajes, animales o elementos naturales, o victimas de explotacion.

Al confiar en un sistema simbolico de diferencia basado en oposiciones binarias y estereotipos, la cobertura mediatica global y las peliculas sobre la Amazonia en la decada de 1970 fungieron como complices en la legitimacion de los tipos de proyectos y politicas llevados a cabo en la region.","[Sarzynski, Sarah] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Hist, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",,"Sarzynski, S (corresponding author), Claremont Mckenna Coll, Hist, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2021.0,48,2,,,,47,62,,10.1177/0094582X20988694,,,,,,,,WOS:000633050400004,

Hg content in sediments is dependent mainly on the content of organic matter and is highest on the outskirts of the reservoir. The flux of Hg increased more than fivefold from the dry to the rainy season in the former river Tocantins channel. The concentrations of Hg in floating plants were higher in the roots and submerged leaves than in the shoots and floating leaves. Seasonal variations in Hg levels could be explained by competition with nutrients or growth dilution effects. Properties of the soil, the vegetation type and the natural fluctuation of water might affect the concentration of Hg in the floating plants.

In this study, two different species of acai pulp extracts, naturally grown in two distinct regions of the Amazon, namely, Euterpe oleracea Mart. (habitat: Brazilian floodplains of the Amazon) and Euterpe precatoria Mart. (habitat: Bolivian Amazon), were studied for their effects on brain health and cognition. Methods: Neurochemical analyses were performed in critical brain regions associated with memory and cognition of 19-month-old acai-fed rats, in whom the cognitive benefits of acai had been established. Results: Results indicated significant reductions (P< 0.05) in prooxidant NADPH-oxidoreductase-2 (NOX2) and proinflammatory transcription factor NF-B in acai-fed rats. Measurement of Nrf2 expression, a transcription factor for antioxidant enzymes, and a possible link between oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and autophagy mechanisms, indicated significant overexpression (P<0.005) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of the acai-fed rats. Furthermore, significant activation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes GST and SOD were also observed in the acai-fed animals when compared to control. Analysis of autophagy markers such as p62, phospho-mTOR, beclin1 and MAP1B-LC3 revealed differential expression in frontal cortex and hippocampus, mostly indicating an upregulation in the acai-fed rats. Discussion: In general, results were more profound for EP than EO in hippocampus as well as frontal cortex. Therefore, an acai-enriched diet could possibly modulate Nrf2, which is known to modulate the intracellular redox status, thereby regulating the ubiquitin-proteosomal pathway, ultimately affecting cognitive function in the aging brain.","[Poulose, Shibu M.; Bielinski, Donna F.; Carey, Amanda; Shukitt-Hale, Barbara] Tufts Univ, USDA ARS, Human Nutr Res Ctr Aging, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Carey, Amanda] Simmons Coll, Dept Psychol, 300 Fenway, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schauss, Alexander G.] AIBMR Life Sci, Nat & Med Prod Res, Puyallup, WA USA",,"Shukitt-Hale, B (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, USDA ARS, Human Nutr Res Ctr Aging, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",barbara.shukitthale@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,,22,24,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,20,5,,,,305,315,,10.1080/1028415X.2015.1125654,,,,,,,,WOS:000402115600006,

From this analysis, detailed isopleth maps are provided that allow a graphical characterization of the moisture exposure conditions of facades anywhere in Brazil. A comprehensive characterization of the water penetration exposure in Brazilian enclosures is created and can be used to establish normative design requirements for actual climatic conditions in each area of the country. In general, an increased risk of penetration was identified in the flat areas of the South and Northeast regions of the country.

The freshwater outflow of the Amazon basin is recognized as a major barrier that produces a break between Brazilian and Caribbean faunas. The vast oceanic distances between Brazil and the mid-Atlantic ridge islands represent another formidable barrier. To assess the relative importance of these barriers, we compared a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b gene among populations of three species of Atlantic surgeonfishes:Acanthurus bahianus, A. chirurgus and A. coeruleus. These species have similar life histories but different adult habitat preferences. The mtDNA data show no population structure between Brazil and the mid-Atlantic islands, indicating that this oceanic barrier is readily traversed by the pelagic larval stage of all three surgeonfishes, which spend similar to45-70 days in the pelagic environment. The Amazon is a strong barrier to dispersal of A. bahianus (d = 0.024, Phi(ST) = 0.724), a modest barrier for A. coeruleus (Phi(ST) = 0.356), and has no discernible effect as a barrier for A. chirurgus. The later species has been collected on soft bottoms with sponge habitats under the Amazon outflow, indicating that relaxed adult habitat requirements enable it to readily cross that barrier. A limited ability to use soft bottom habitats may also explain the low (but significant) population structure in A. coeruleus. In contrast, A. bahianus has not been collected over deep sponge bottoms, and rarely settles outside shallow reefs. Overall, adult habitat preferences seem to be the factor that differentiates phylogeographical patterns in these reef-associated species.","Univ Florida, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst Panama, Unit 0948, APO, AA 34002 USA",,"Rocha, LA (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, 7922 NW 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA.",rocha@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu,,,,,,,194,205,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2002.0,11,2,,,,243,252,,10.1046/j.0962-1083.2001.01431.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000173726200008,

It has also received considerable attention from environmental and social non-governmental organizations as a driver of deforestation and land consolidation. While many researchers have examined the impacts of soybean production on human and environmental landscapes, there has been little investigation into the economic and institutional context of Brazilian soybean production or the relationship between soy yields and planted area. This study examines the influence of land tenure, land use policy, cooperatives, and credit access on soy production in Brazil. Using county level data we provide statistical evidence that soy planted area and yields are higher in regions where cooperative membership and credit levels are high, and cheap credit sources are more accessible. This result suggests that soybean production and profitability will increase as supply chain infrastructure improves in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes in Brazil. The yields of competing land uses, wheat, coffee, and cattle production and a complementary use, corn production, also help to determine the location of soybean planted area in Brazil. We do not find a significant relationship between land tenure and planted area or land tenure and yields. Soy yields decline as transportation costs increase, but planted area as a proportion of arable land is highest in some of the areas with very high transportation costs. In particular, counties located within Mato Grosso and counties within the Amazon biome have a larger proportion of their arable, legally available land planted in soy than counties outside of the biome. Finally, we provide evidence that soy yields are positively associated with planted area, implying that policies intending to spare land through yield improvements could actually lead to land expansion in the absence of strong land use regulations. While this study focuses on Brazil, the results underscore the importance of understanding how supply chains influence land use associated with cash crops in other countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These include assessing global forest loss, tracking water resources across Earth's surface, determining disturbance frequency across decades, and many more. These advances have been greatly facilitated by Google Earth Engine, which provides both image access and a platform for advanced analysis techniques. Within the realm of land-use/land-cover (LULC) classifications, Earth Engine provides the ability to create new classifications and to access major existing data sets that have already been created, particularly at global extents. By overlaying global LULC classifications-the 300-m GlobCover 2009 LULC data set for example-with sharper images like those from Landsat, one can see the promise and limits of these global data sets and platforms to fuse them. Despite the promise in a global classification covering all of the terrestrial surface, GlobCover 2009 may be too coarse for some applications. We asked whether the LULC labeling provided by GlobCover 2009 could be combined with the spatial granularity of the Landsat platform to produce a hybrid classification having the best features of both resources with high accuracy. Here we apply an improvement of the Bayesian Updating of Land Cover (BULC) algorithm that fused unsupervised Landsat classifications to GlobCover 2009, sharpening the result from a 300-m to a 30-m classification. Working with four clear categories in Mato Grosso, Brazil, we refined the resolution of the LULC classification by an order of magnitude while improving the overall accuracy from 69.1 to 97.5%. This BULC-U mode, because it uses unsupervised classifications as inputs, demands less region-specific knowledge from analysts and may be significantly easier for non-specialists to use. This technique can provide new information to land managers and others interested in highly accurate classifications at finer scales.","[Lee, Jacky; Cardille, Jeffrey A.] McGill Sch Environm, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Coe, Michael T.] Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA",,"Cardille, JA (corresponding author), McGill Sch Environm, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",jacky.hy.lee@gmail.com; jeffrey.cardille@mcgill.ca; mtcoe@whrc.org,,,,,,,14,15,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2018.0,10,9,,,,,,1455,10.3390/rs10091455,,,,,,,,WOS:000449993800135,

Some doubt is cast on the species status of P. cardosoi.,Lysapsus limellum, P. bolbodactyla, and P. paradoxa each may comprise more than one species, but lack of comprehensive geographic and morphological appraisals precludes taxonomic changes. Biogeographic implications of the phylogeny are discussed. The correlation between hydrographic basins and Pseudis species is not fully supported, and a recent contact between Amazon populations in eastern Bolivia and western Brazil (Rondonia) and Parana basin populations in the Pantanal is suggested. A dispersal-vicariance analysis showed that major diversification of Pseudis and Lysapsus species occurred in the Brazilian Shield, and that the presence of P. paradoxa and L. limellum in the Amazon and Parana basins is due to recent dispersals. Evidence suggests a vicariant event, most likely caused by Miocene marine introgressions, as the cause for the restricted distribution of L. laevis in the Guiana Shield. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In an attempt to clarify the complex systematics and phylogeography of this taxon, we provide a first molecular analysis. We obtained mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (mtCOII) gene sequences from 49 tufted capuchins that had exact geographic origins from diverse lineages in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, French Guyana, Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay and that belonged to clearly recognized morphological taxa. This project had 4 main findings: (1) we determined 2 established and related taxa in the northern Amazon River area, which we named C. a. apella and C. a. fatuellus. C. a. apella is distributed from French Guyana until, at least, the Negro River in the northern Brazilian Amazon, whereas C. a. fatuellus is distributed throughout the Colombian Eastern Llanos and the northern Colombian Amazon. We also determined 2 other southern C. apella taxa, which we named C. a. macrodon and C. a. cay. C. a. macrodon has a western and southern Amazon distribution, while C. a. cay has a more southern distribution outside the Amazon basin. (2) In the upper Amazon basin, there is a unique lineage (C. a. macrocephalus) with 1 widely distributed haplotype. The 4 morphological subspecies (C. a. maranonis, C. a. macrocephalus, C. a. peruanus, C. a. pallidus), and maybe a fifth unknown subspecies, described in this area were molecularly undifferentiated at least for the mitochondrial gene analyzed. (3) Our molecular analysis determined that 1 individual of C. robustus fell into the lineage of C. a. macrocephalus. Therefore, this form does not receive any specific name. (4) The animals classified a priori as C. nigritus and C. xanthosternos (because of their morphological phenotypes and by their geographical origins) were clearly differentiated from the other specimens analyzed with the molecular marker employed. Therefore, we consider that these 2 lineages could be assigned the status of full species following the biological species definition. (5) In 2001, Groves described 4 tufted capuchin species (C. apella, C. libidinosus, C. nigritus and C. xanthosternos), while Silva Jr. determined 7 species (C. apella, C. macrocephalus, C. libidinosus, C. cay, C. nigritus, C. robustus and C. xanthosternos). The tests of Swofford-Olsen-Waddell-Hillis, of Shimodaira and Hasegawa and of Templeton did not fit with either of these two classificatory schemes, although Groves' scheme was better with regard to our data than that of Silva Jr. (6) All the temporal splits among the tufted capuchin taxa studied were estimated to have occurred during the last phase of the Pleistocene by using the p statistic applied to the median joining haplotype network.

This paper investigates the broad variation in soil properties of the Amazon Basin as they influence transfers of plant nutrients from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere and the aquatic biosphere. The dominant lowland soils are highly weathered Oxisols and Ultisols, but significant areas of Alfisols also exist, resulting in a wide range of weatherable primary minerals. Despite this considerable variation among Amazonian soils, a common feature in most mature lowland Amazonian forests is a conservative P cycle and excess N availability. In cattle pastures and secondary forests, however, low rates of internal terrestrial N cycling, low N export to streams, and low gaseous N emissions from soils are common, due to significant previous losses of N through repeated fire. Export of P to streams may increase or remain nearly undetectable after forest-to-pasture conversion, depending on soil type. Oxisols exhibit very low P export, whereas increased P export to pasture streams has been observed in Ultisols of western Amazonia. Calcium is mostly retained in terrestrial ecosystems following deforestation, although increased inputs to streams can be detected when background fluxes are naturally low. Because soil mineralogy and soil texture are both variable and important, the effects of land-use change on nutrient export to aquatic ecosystems and to the atmosphere must be understood within the context of varying soil properties across the Amazon Basin.","Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,"Davidson, EA (corresponding author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, POB 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",edavidson@whrc.org,,,,,,,30,31,,,,,,,,,,,,2004.0,153,,,,,147,158,,10.1029/153GM12,,,,,,,,WOS:000226789500011,

The main objectives of the study were: (1) to determine if damage incidence to future crop trees (FCTs; >= 20 cm diameter at breast height (dbh)) differs between (a) forest with and without bamboo (Guadua spp.), and (b) trees with and without lianas; (2) to what extent harvesting can be conducted more intensely (m(3)ha(-1)), without incurring greater FCT damage; and (3) to what extent marking diminishes FCT damage. Full inventories of FCTs of 50 commercial species complexes were conducted before and after logging in 50 m-radius zones of impact around each designated harvest tree in three 10 ha (200 m x 500 m) logging blocks. We also mapped all forested areas potentially influenced by logging, including skid trails, log landings and felling gaps, throughout the 30 ha logged. More than 28% of the forest area was disturbed by logging, with 12.1% in skid trails and 16.8% in gap clearings, indicating that the forest gap mosaic can be significantly altered even when reduced-impact logging guidelines are followed. Overall, 15% of FCTs inventoried were damaged. Damage rates were not significantly reduced by marking treatment, location in bamboo-dominated forest, or liana load on FCT damage. Harvest intensity did not influence the probability of FCT damage. For future studies, it would be prudent to address impacts of timber extraction on other livelihood activities, such as non-timber forest product collection, particularly in such regions as the Brazilian Amazon, where many communities are attempting to integrate a suite of income-generating activities.

It seeks to understand how characteristics of family farms shift as a function of property size, arguing that as production intensifies, properties move closer to a HOT state. In this state, resources are committed to maintaining robustness against expected disturbances, such as shifts in yields or crop prices, making property more vulnerable to other unexpected disturbances, such as shifts in input prices or availability. The shifts in production, labor, and costs that occur across scale in the Ji-Parana River Basin in Rondonia were measured using a survey instrument on a sample of farmers in the basin. Study results show decreasing production intensity with increasing property size in the sample, coupled with decreasing contracted and family labor use intensity, as well as decreased income diversification and off-farm labor. Farms smaller than 60 ha in the sample differed markedly in production and cost structure from those that were larger. For these smaller properties, meeting the requirements of Rondonia's new environmental licensing program (LAPRO) may lead to an increase in the sale of land parcels to cover debts and a speeding up of land consolidation in the region.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Bell, AR (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,16,2,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,WOS:000292462800019,

Notably, this severity has been recently suggested to be associated with chloroquine resistance. Patients: Two different patients presented at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona with P. vivax malaria episodes. One patient had severe symptoms and the other mild symptoms. Both patients traveled through the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus) in 2007. For both patients the current diagnosis of malaria was the first. Two other patients with mild symptoms presented to the Centro de Pesquisa em Medicina Tropical, also in the Brazilian Amazon (Rondonia) in 2000. Methods: To exclude the possibility that the patient's severe symptoms were due to Plasmodium falciparum, a nested PCR was performed. A magnetic method was used to purify P. vivax free of human leukocytes. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to compare the transcript levels of two main transporters likely to be involved in chloroquine resistance in P. vivax, namely the P. vivax chloroquine resistance transporter, pvcrt-o, and the P. vivax multidrug resistance transporter, pvmdr 1. Results: Results demonstrated that the severe clinical symptoms were exclusively due to P. vivax. The patient presented acute respiratory conditions requiring admission to the intensive care unit. The magnetic method showed highly purified infected-reticulocytes with mature stages. In addition, it was found that parasites obtained from the severe patient had up to 2.9-fold increase in pvmdr1 levels and up to 21.9-fold increase in pvcrt-o levels compared to expression levels of parasites from the other patients with mild symptoms. Conclusion: This is the first clinical case of severe disease exclusively associated with vivax malaria in Spain. Moreover, these findings suggest that clinical severity could be associated with increased expression levels of parasite genes likely involved in chloroquine resistance. It is necessary to further explore the potential of pvmdr1 and particularly pvcrt-o expression levels as molecular markers of severe disease in P. vivax.","[Fernandez-Becerra, Carmen; Pinazo, Maria Jesus; Gonzalez, Ana; Alonso, Pedro L.; del Portillo, Hernando A.; Gascon, Joaquim] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, Hosp Clin IDIBAPS, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [del Portillo, Hernando A.] Passeig Lluis Co, Catalan Inst Res & Adv Studies ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain",,"del Portillo, HA (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, Hosp Clin IDIBAPS, Rosello 132,4A Planta, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain.",carmen.fernandez@cresib.cat; mpinazo@clinic.ub.es; portana1@hotmail.com; palonso@clinic.ub.es; hernandoa.delportillo@cresib.cat; JGASCON@clinic.ub.es,,,,,,,38,39,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2,2009.0,8,,,,,,,55,10.1186/1475-2875-8-55,,,,,,,,WOS:000266325600002,

Neogene - Quaternary early,CALDASIA,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Stratigraphic units of the Colombian Amazon region are composed of the following geological formations: Solimoes late Miocene age (Neogene period 23.3 to 2.6 Ma Miocene-Pliocene), the Formation Jerico described herein and that was deposited between the Pliocene and Pleistocene, and the formation Isa (Ica), which has been considered of Pleistocene age. In the Holocene is predominant sedimentary material directly related or not with the influence of the Amazon River. Although much of the sedimentary environments of the Solimoes Formation of Tertiary age correspond to rivers and floodplain forest vegetation, lakes and marshes (pantanales) are also present. Some of them have high concentration of salts in solution and sequences of hardened paleosoils that covers positive landforms formed in environments where some vegetation types are similar to the present types but with woodland savannas. The evidence suggests a warm climate with a prolonged dry season. The following stratigraphic unit, which is described herein Jerico, lies in a discordant form on the Solimoes Formation and correspons to fluvial sediments that have been affected by the processes of generation of bauxites after his deposition. This action requires warm climates with a long rainy period, followed by a short dry season. The evidence of processes occurring in the two formations indicates that during the Neogene, the Amazon region (at least the Colombian part) experienced a climate with a dry season, being very long during Solimoes Formation and short in Jerico Formation, but in both cases the climatic conditions were different to the actual climate. Isa Formation has a fluvial origin, with hilly topography that protrudes 2 or 3 meters above the terrace of Leticia, and the nearby Brazilian territory is not covered by the existing terrace. The detritus of the Isa formation have been contributed by reworking of the Jerico Formation and were deposited under very humid condition, with higher rainfall amounts than today. There are materials that directly depend on the involvement of the Amazon River while others are not affected by these dynamics. Among the materials that are not affected by the current cycle are the terrace of Leticia, which covers the Ica Formation. This terrace is the highest of the geological units among those that still retain their original flat morphology. On this terrace there are deposits of drainage channels associated with drainage of the terrace and the floodplain that are important to recognize the differential processes of erosion. Other geologic units are associated to flooded areas by the annual cycle of the Amazon River belong to the Quaternary and can be differentiated according to the relative age, spatial position, development over the water surface, and the dynamics of the Amazon River in the Colombian territory. A description about these units will be treated in a forthcoming paper.","[Jaramillo Justinico, Alexis; Orlando Rangel-Ch, J.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Nat, Bogota, Colombia; [Parra Sanchez, Luis Norberto] Univ Nacl Colombia, Medellin, Colombia",,"Justinico, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Nat, Apartado 7495, Bogota, Colombia.",alexjustinico@gmail.com; lnparra@gmail.com; jorangelc@unal.edu.co,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,33,2,,,,539,572,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000208834300015,

In low- to no-input tree-based agroecosystems growing in tropical Ultisols and Oxisols, soil P availability depends heavily on factors that influence mineralization from decomposing litter. Using anion exchange resin membranes (AERMs), we monitored monthly fluctuations in soil solution P in an eight-year-old peach palm (Bactris gasipaes)-cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum) commercial plantation agroforest to determine if changes in P availability were related to environmental factors controlling organic matter decomposition (precipitation, soil moisture and temperature) and seasonal fluctuations in litterfall and fruit harvest. Decomposition and C, N, and P dynamics in leaf litter were also studied to determine if soil P availability might be related to species differences in litter quality (initial leaf C, N and P contents) and thus differing rates of P release or immobilization. Although AERMs acted as dynamic exchangers, they appeared adequately sensitive to detect fluctuations in monthly soil P availability, despite inherently low soil extractable P concentrations. Soil P availability was greatest early in the rainy season, when both litterfall and a cycle of soil-wetting and drying were initiated, decreasing during the mid-rainy season when fruit production peaked. AERM P was greatest in superficial palm root mate, where decomposing litter accumulates, and in mineral soil beneath palm litter. This corresponded with greater N and P release from more P-rich palm leaf litter. Phosphorus immobilization in initially P-poor cupuassu leaves appears to have contributed to lowered P availability in soil underlying this species' litter. Phosphorus availability was lowest in bare mineral soil located agroforest alleys where litter accumulation was minimal. Greater overall P availability in peach palm litter-covered soil and root mats may contribute to observed higher productivity in this species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The basic reason is that one region's reversal can be facilitated by other regions that supply resources and goods, reducing the demands upon the region where forests rise. Many past forest reversals involve such interdependence. For 'facilitating regions' also to rise in forest requires other changes, since they will not be receiving such help. We start by discussing forest-transitions analysis within the context of Environmental Kuznets Curves (EKCs), for a useful typology of possible shifts underlying transitions. We then consider the historical Northeast US where a regional reversal was dramatic and impressive. Yet this depended upon agricultural price shocks, due to the Midwest US supplying food, and also upon the availability of timber from other US regions. Next we consider deforestation in Amazonia, whose history (like the Northeast US) suggests a potential local role for urbanization, i.e. spatial concentration of population.

Bowen ratio teleconnects to circulation and precipitation processes far afield, and the global CO2 growth rate is strongly influenced by carbon cycle processes in South America. However, quantification of basin-wide seasonality of flux partitioning between latent and sensible heat, the response to anomalies around climatic norms, and understanding of the processes and mechanisms that control the carbon cycle remains elusive. Here, we investigate simulated surface-atmosphere interaction at a single site in Brazil, using models with different representations of precipitation and cloud processes, as well as differences in scale of coupling between the surface and atmosphere. We find that the model with parameterized clouds/precipitation has a tendency toward unrealistic perpetual light precipitation, while models with explicit treatment of clouds produce more intense and less frequent rain. Models that couple the surface to the atmosphere on the scale of kilometers, as opposed to tens or hundreds of kilometers, produce even more realistic distributions of rainfall. Rainfall intensity has direct consequences for the fate of water, or the pathway that a hydrometeor follows once it interacts with the surface. We find that the model with explicit treatment of cloud processes, coupled to the surface at small scales, is the most realistic when compared to observations. These results have implications for simulations of global climate, as the use of models with explicit (as opposed to parameterized) cloud representations becomes more widespread.","[Baker, Ian T.; Denning, A.

To address this challenge, we have developed a cost-effective mapping procedure based on 250-m MODIS imagery that produces annual land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This procedure uses annual spectral statistics, collection of references samples with a Web-based tool, and tree-based Random Forests classifiers stratified by biome map regions to produce wall-to-wall, annual LULC maps for 2001 to 2010 that cover all of LAC. Across 26 map regions, overall pixel-level accuracy averaged 80.2 +/- 8.1% for eight basic LULC classes, and 84.6 +/- 6.5% for a five-class scheme. Municipality-scale area change between 2001 and 2010 in the three dominant classes (woody vegetation, mixed woody/plantation, and agriculture/herbaceous vegetation) was then estimated using regression models fit to 10 years of data, thus minimizing the impact of inter-annual class variation on change statistics. Closed-canopy forest area and change between 2001 and 2009 were well correlated with high-resolution maps of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES project). Our LAC-wide analysis of significant change revealed the recent extent and magnitude of deforestation hotspots, such as in the Amazon moist forests and the dry forests of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. Our data also revealed biome-specific clusters of municipalities with increasing woody vegetation due to forest recovery, reforestation, or woody encroachment. Taken as a whole, our MODIS-based mapping and trend modeling methodology can provide reliable land change data, not just for the tropics or for forest cover, but for all biomes and municipalities in LAC and including multiple LULC classes. Because this information can be produced quickly on an annual time scale, with internally-consistent data sources, it is a very useful tool for resource managers, policy makers, scientists and conservationists interested in tracking recent land change across broad-scale, political and environmental gradients.

Deforestation typically leads to changes in climate, biodiversity, hydrological cycle, and soil degradation. Vegetation succession plays an important role in soil restoration through accumulation of vegetation biomass and improved soil/plant interaction. However, relationships between succession and soil properties are not well known. For example, how does vegetation succession affect nutrient accumulation? Which soil factors are important in influencing vegetation growth? What is the best way to evaluate soil fertility in the Amazon basin? This paper focuses on the interrelationships between secondary succession and soil properties. Field soil sample data and vegetation inventory data were collected in two regions of Brazilian Amazonia (Altamira and Bragantina). Soil nutrients and texture were analyzed at successional forest sites. Multiple regression models were used to identify the important soil properties affecting vegetation growth, and a soil evaluation factor (SEF) was developed for evaluating soil fertility in Alfisols, Ultisols, and Oxisols, which differ in the ways they affect vegetation growth. For example, the upper 40 cm of soil is most important for vegetation growth in Alfisols, but in Ultisols and Oxisols deeper horizons significantly influence vegetation growth rates. Accumulation of vegetation biomass increased soil fertility and improved soil physical structure in Alfisols but did not completely compensate for the nutrient losses in Ultisols and Oxisols; however, it significantly reduced the rate of nutrient loss.

We also analyzed the 308 fish samples, representing 36 species, for stable isotopes (N-15 and C-13) to estimate their trophic position. Trophic position was positively correlated with the log-transformed Hg concentrations in fish among all sites. There was a lack of relationship between Hg concentrations in fish and either Hg concentrations in sediments or ASGM activity among sites, suggesting that fish Hg concentrations alone is not an ideal bioindicator of site-specific Hg contamination in the region. Fish Hg concentrations were not elevated in the ASGM-impacted river relative to the other two rivers; however, sediment Hg concentrations were highest in the ASGM-impacted river. Degraded habitat conditions and commensurate shifts in fish species and ecological processes may influence Hg bioaccumulation in the ASGM-impacted river.

This work initially shows how the dry season soil moisture and water stress in typical Amazonian pasture modifies the energy partitioning at the surface. Low-level moisture convergence is a primary mechanism to trigger convective cloud formation and precipitation. The relationship between moisture convergence and local surface evaporation in generating precipitation in Amazonia is studied utilizing a one-dimensional 'single column' model (SiB-1D). SiB-1D couples a surface-vegetation model (SiB) to a physical parametrization of deep convection (Kuo scheme), radiation, turbulent diffusion and large-scale precipitation. Model simulations for short periods (2 days) show its ability to calculate the Amazonian surface energy-balance components and boundary-layer dynamics when compared with field observations from the Rondonia Boundary-Layer Experiment and the Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observation Study. The model was further used to test the sensitivity of the deep convection scheme to a range of typical low-level moisture convergence situations in a second experiment, and a third test investigated the local convective precipitation generated over forest and grass vegetation as a function of available soil moisture. Results showed that the rainfall over forest vegetation appeared to be almost insensitive to soil water stress whereas reduced precipitation was generated over pasture. When available soil water fell below a threshold of 60% the calculated precipitation over the pasture sites rapidly declined. Although these results are confined by the short integration period and the initial atmospheric profiles, they help to strengthen the notion that deforestation reduces evaporation and convective precipitation, especially during the dry season: a result already indicated by some previous general-circulation model experiments.","INST HYDROL, WALLINGFORD OX10 8BB, OXON, ENGLAND; NASA, GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR, GREENBELT, MD 20771 USA",,,,,,,,,,23,23,,,,,,,,,,,APR,1996.0,122,531,A,,,567,594,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UK53000001,

The construction consortium dominated the process of dispossession with politics of non-recognition that assigned valuelessness to local ways of life and concepts of property. Aggravated by the prevalence of clientelistic relations that blocked formal negotiation opportunities, this induced a process of fragmentation and the precarization of many residents. However, some residents organized and offered resistance. Through performative acts of citizenship, they constituted themselves as political subjects and transformed the conflict into an agonistic struggle. Nevertheless, they continued to be dominated by the consortium and in their resistance forcedly legitimized its politics of displacement.

Taking this into account, we estimate the deforestation impacts of these protection types that feature different levels of restrictions. To avoid bias, we compare these protected locations with unprotected locations that are similar in their characteristics relevant for deforestation. We find that sustainable use protection, whose governance permits some local deforestation, is found on sites with high clearing threat. That allows more avoided deforestation than from integral protection, which bans clearing but seems feasible only further from deforestation threats.

Mig. (Piperaceae) are used locally as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, hepatoprotective and diuretic infusions and to treat external ulcers and local infections in several parts of the Peruvian, Bolivian and Brazilian Amazon region. The antioxidant activity of different extracts of P. peltata was studied using the hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence assay in liver homogenates, and the methanolic extract was found to have the highest antioxidant activity, with an IC50 = 4 mu g/ml. Aqueous and dichloromethane extracts did not show antioxidant activity. The extracts were further evaluated using the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TEARS) assay. Finally, an assay of DNA sugar damage induced by Fe (II) salt was used to determine the capacity of the extracts to suppress the oxidative degradation of DNA. All the extracts showed antioxidant activity in the latter two bioassays. The methanolic extract showed the highest activity in reducing oxidative damage to DNA, with an IC50 = 5 mu g/ml. Since this extract was highly effective in reducing chemiluminescence and DNA damage, and because the latter activity could be due to the presence of compounds that bind to DNA, DNA-binding activity was studied using the DNA-methyl green (DNA-MG) bioassay. A 30% decrease in the initial absorbance of DNA-MG complex was observed in the methanolic extract at 1000 mu g/ml, suggesting the presence of compounds that bind to genetic material. No DNA-binding activity was observed in the aqueous or dichloromethane extracts.","UNIV BUENOS AIRES,FAC FARM & BIOQUIM,CATEDRA FARMACOGNOSIA,IQUIMEFA CONICET,RA-1113 BUENOS AIRES,DF,ARGENTINA",,"Desmarchelier, C (corresponding author), UNIV BUENOS AIRES,FAC FARM & BIOQUIM,CATEDRA BIOTECNOL & MICROBIOL IND,JUNIN 956,RA-1113 BUENOS AIRES,DF,ARGENTINA.",,,,,,,,9,10,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,1997.0,30,1,,,,85,91,,10.1590/S0100-879X1997000100014,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997WE79900014,

Three channels through which property rights affect these variables are identified in the analysis. Two involve the expenditure the farmer incurs to defend the land claim, and the third involves the interest rate premium the farmer faces when borrowing without a clear title to the land. Variants of the model allow for labor to defend the land claim and for endogenous property rights.

As a consequence the industrialised countries have adopted Hg-free products and processes, because a continued use of Hg would result in diffuse emissions even if used Hg is recycled. However, Western Europe exports about 100 tons of Hg to Brazil each year, where it is emitted over the Amazon. The export from Europe began during the 1980s, when a gold mining boom spread like wildfire in the Amazon. Mercury agglutinates gold grains by forming an amalgam. Later on the gold is purified from the Hg by heating. The Hg evaporates into the air and is subsequently deposited onto land and in surface waters. Another important Hg polluter is China, which has increased its burning of coal without appropriate smoke cleaning devices and is also importing considerable amounts of Hg for industrial use and for use in gold mining. Regional Hg emissions contribute to global Hg pollution due to the mobility of Hg. A ban on the Hg trade in Europe and North America would significantly diminish global Hg pollution. A ban would also result in the closing of the state-owned Hg mine (MAYASA) in Almaden, Spain, the world's most important anthropogenic Hg source.","Univ Uppsala, Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden",,"Hylander, LD (corresponding author), Univ Uppsala, Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,,50,60,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2001.0,125,1-4,,,,331,344,,10.1023/A:1005231017807,,,,,,,,WOS:000166638600020,

However, some of the inconsistencies observed with results from Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based RDTs could also be explained by the deletion of the gene that encodes the protein, pfhrp2, and its structural homolog, pfhrp3, in some parasite isolates. Given that pfhrp2- and pfhrp3-negative P. falciparum isolates have been detected in the neighboring Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon regions, we hypothesized that parasites with deletions of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 may also be present in Colombia. In this study we tested 100 historical samples collected between 1999 and 2009 from six Departments in Colombia for the presence of pfhrp2, pfhrp3 and their flanking genes. Seven neutral microsatellites were also used to determine the genetic background of these parasites. In total 18 of 100 parasite isolates were found to have deleted pfhrp2, a majority of which (14 of 18) were collected from Amazonas Department, which borders Peru and Brazil. pfhrp3 deletions were found in 52 of the100 samples collected from all regions of the country. pfhrp2 flanking genes PF3D7_0831900 and PF3D7_0831700 were deleted in 22 of 100 and in 1 of 100 samples, respectively. pfhrp3 flanking genes PF3D7_1372100 and PF3D7_1372400 were missing in 55 of 100 and in 57 of 100 samples. Structure analysis of microsatellite data indicated that Colombian samples tested in this study belonged to four clusters and they segregated mostly based on their geographic region. Most of the pfhrp2deleted parasites were assigned to a single cluster and originated from Amazonas Department although a few pfhrp2-negative parasites originated from the other three clusters. The presence of a high proportion of pfhrp2-negative isolates in the Colombian Amazon may have implications for the use of PfHRP2-based RDTs in the region and may explain inconsistencies observed when PfHRP2-based tests and assays are performed.","[Murillo Solano, Claribel; Pava, Zuleima; Dorado, Erika] Ctr Int Entrenamiento & Invest Med CIDEIM, Cali, Colombia; [Okoth, Sheila Akinyi; Abdallah, Joseph F.; Huber, Curtis S.; de Oliveira, Alexandre Macedo; Udhayakumar, Venkatachalam; Barnwell, John W.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Ctr Global Hlth, Div Parasit Dis & Malaria, Malaria Branch, Atlanta, GA USA; [Okoth, Sheila Akinyi] Atlanta Res & Educ Fdn, Decatur, GA USA; [Incardona, Sandra; Bell, David] Fdn Innovat New Diagnost, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland; [Bell, David] Global Good Fund, Intellectual Ventures Lab, Bellevue, WA USA",,"Solano, CM (corresponding author), Ctr Int Entrenamiento & Invest Med CIDEIM, Carrera 125 19-225 Av, Cali, Colombia.",claribel_murillo@cideim.org.co,,,,,,,43,43,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 7,2015.0,10,7,,,,,,e0131576,10.1371/journal.pone.0131576,,,,,,,,WOS:000358158900020,

Human actions destroy between 1 and 2 million km(2) of such forests per decade, with concomitant carbon release into the atmosphere. Within these forests, protected areas are the principle defense against forest loss and species extinctions. Four regions-the Amazon, Congo, South American Atlantic Coast, and West Africa-once constituted about half the world's tropical moist forest. We measure forest cover at progressively larger distances inside and outside of protected areas within these four regions, using data-sets on protected areas and land-cover. We find important geographical differences. In the Amazon and Congo, protected areas are generally large and retain high levels of forest cover, as do their surroundings. These areas are protected de facto by being inaccessible and will likely remain protected if they continue to be so. Deciding whether they are also protected de jure - that is, whether effective laws also protect them-is statistically difficult, for there are few controls. In contrast, protected areas in the Atlantic Coast forest and West Africa show sharp boundaries in forest cover at their edges. This effective protection of forest cover is partially offset by their very small size: little area is deep inside protected area boundaries. Lands outside protected areas in the Atlantic Coast forest are unusually fragmented. Finally, we ask whether global databases on protected areas are biased toward highly protected areas and ignore paper parks. Analysis of a Brazilian database does not support this presumption.","[Joppa, Lucas N.; Loarie, Scott R.; Pimm, Stuart L.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Pimm, SL (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",stuartpimm@aol.com,,,,,,,318,337,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 6,2008.0,105,18,,,,6673,6678,,10.1073/pnas.0802471105,,,,,,,,WOS:000255841600030,

Fires in savannas and evergreen forests increased in parallel during drought events in 2005,2007 and 2010, suggesting similar regional climate controls on fire behavior.

Injections of international resources into underdeveloped, often clientelistic societies can fundamentally change the nature of the local political arena, affecting access to economic resources, social benefits, and ultimately the quality of democratic representation, The authors analyze the impact external resources have on politics by examining a series of World Bank-funded projects based in the Brazilian Amazon from 1995 to 1997, They show that World Bank funding designed to channel resources to local groups had powerful effects in the political arena, increasing electoral support for the Left in the 1998 presidential race.

Based on the current international regulatory framework, the global political economy of reinsurance is becoming a constitutive element of human rights governance. Conceptualising underwriting as a social practice, we observe how human rights norms are translated into the corporate form of risks. This process goes beyond questions of norm compliance and involves practices of valuation and boundary-drawing based on the underwriter's competences and background knowledge about reinsurance markets, value chains and corporate hierarchies. We conclude with a critique of private governance as an institutional pillar of the human rights system that rests on business rationales rather than lending institutional power to rights-holders.","[Scheper, Christian] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Dev & Peace, Lotharstr 53, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany; [Goerdemann, Johanna] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Philosophy, Essen, Germany",,"Scheper, C (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Dev & Peace, Lotharstr 53, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",cscheper@inef.uni-due.de,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 4,2022.0,27,2,,,,225,239,,10.1080/13563467.2021.1881470,,FEB 2021,,,,,,WOS:000615835800001,

We applied subspace classification methods to LANDSAT data from 1986, 1999, and 2018 and used grid cells at scales of 150, 300, 600, and 900 m to measure deforestation trajectories. The 150 m grids provided better detail to determine deforestation trajectories than coarser-scale grid cells. Differences in grid-cell scale did not influence the statistical trends in land-cover changes significantly. Changes in forest area were negatively correlated with changes in cropland (r= -.44), grassland (r= -.34), swamp grassland (r= -.38), and regrowth (r= -.32) areas. Correlations between forest losses in cropland, grassland, and regrowth change analyses were weaker between 1999 and 2018 compared to 1986 to 1999. Forest cover declined from 6,635 km(2)(1986) to 3,800 km(2)(2018), and the deforestation rate increased from an annual average of 1.36% between 1986 and 1999 to 2.0% between 1999 and 2018. The key proximate drivers of forest clearance rates and patterns were increasing population, agricultural expansion, and road building. While coca is an economically important crop in Chapare, its direct and indirect effects on deforestation could not be determined unambiguously. It is probable that the expansion of agriculture will lead to further deforestation and forest fragmentation and, along with decreases in forest cover, further changes will take place between non-forest categories.","[Bagan, Hasi] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Bagan, Hasi; Yamagata, Yoshiki] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, Ibaraki, Japan; [Millington, Andrew] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Takeuchi, Wataru] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan",,"Bagan, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.",hasi.bagan@nies.go.jp,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020.0,31,18,,,,3024,3039,,10.1002/ldr.3692,,JUL 2020,,,,,,WOS:000552823000001,

We assess whether and how this has occurred with timber resources in the Brazilian Amazon. The asynchronous advance of industrial-scale logging frontiers has left regional-scale forest landscapes with varying histories of logging. Initial harvests in unlogged forests can be highly selective, targeting slow-growing, high-grade, shade-tolerant hardwood species, while later harvests tend to focus on fast-growing, light-wooded, long-lived pioneer trees. Brazil accounts for 85% of all native neotropical forest roundlog production, and the State of Para for almost half of all timber production in Brazilian Amazonia, the largest old-growth tropical timber reserve controlled by any country. Yet the degree to which timber harvests beyond the first-cut can be financially profitable or demographically sustainable remains poorly understood. Here, we use data on legally planned logging of similar to 17.3 million cubic meters of timber across 314 species extracted from 824 authorized harvest areas in private and community-owned forests, 446 of which reported volumetric composition data by timber species. We document patterns of timber extraction by volume, species composition, and monetary value along aging eastern Amazonian logging frontiers, which are then explained on the basis of historical and environmental variables. Generalized linear models indicate that relatively recent logging operations farthest from heavy-traffic roads are the most selective, concentrating gross revenues on few high-value species. We find no evidence that the post-logging timber species composition and total value of forest stands recovers beyond the first-cut, suggesting that the commercially most valuable timber species become predictably rare or economically extinct in old logging frontiers. In avoiding even more destructive land-use patterns, managing yields of selectively-logged forests is crucial for the long-term integrity of forest biodiversity and financial viability of local industries. The logging history of eastern Amazonian old-growth forests likely mirrors unsustainable patterns of timber depletion over time in Brazil and other tropical countries.","[Richardson, Vanessa A.; Peres, Carlos A.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",,"Richardson, VA (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",vanessa-anne.richardson@uea.ac.uk; C.Peres@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,33,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 13,2016.0,11,7,,,,,,e0159035,10.1371/journal.pone.0159035,,,,,,,,WOS:000379508300052,

Among the xenarthrans, sloths constitute the most diverse paleontologically with almost 100 fossil genera recorded. However, this abundant sloth fauna in the Americas became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Only six species belonging to two genera,Bradypus(four three-toed sloth species) andCholoepus(two two-toed sloth species) are alive today in Central and South America.Bradypus variegatusis the sloth species with the widest geographical distribution in the Neotropics. Some regional population genetics have been reported, especially in Brazil, but with limited sample sizes. Herein, we sequenced 77 samples ofBradypys variegatus(Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil; 65 new samples and 12 from GenBank), plus oneB. tridactylus, oneB. pygmaeus, and fiveB. torquatus(one new and four from GenBank) at the mitochondrial (mt) control region. Additionally, 25 of these samples, representing the four species, were sequenced for the entire mitochondrial genome. Our results indicate that there are at least six main genetically different haplogroups ofB. variegatus.They are the trans-Andean, western Amazon (with some other internal groups), Tapajos River, Tocantins River, Negro River, and the Brazilian eastern Atlantic forest (with two recognizable sub-groups in northern and southern areas) ones, with the ancestor of the trans-Andean haplogroup the first to diverge. A very strong genetic heterogeneity and a striking spatial pattern were detected among these different geographical areas, with the trans-Andean, western Amazon, and Tocantins populations showing the highest levels of genetic diversity, meanwhile the Tapajos and the Brazilian eastern populations yielding lower levels of genetic diversity. The following conclusions were as follows: 1)B. torquatusshould be considered as a different genus (Scaeopus) because of its extreme genetic differences from otherBradypustaxa as was previously claimed by other authors; 2)B. pygmaeusis not a recent species adapted to Holocene island environments from the Central AmericaB. variegatusgroup; and 3) if we adopt a strict version of the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC), the highly significant monophyletic clade of the trans-AndeanB. variegatuspopulation should be defined as a valid and differentiated species of three-toed sloth. However, we are reluctant to define this population as a new species until new data shows possible strong karyotype differences and/or pre- or post-zygote reproductive barriers (Biological Species Concept, BSC) between the trans and the cis-Andean populations of the three-toed brown-throated sloth.","[Ruiz-Garcia, Manuel; Chacon, Diego] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Lab Genet Poblac Biol Evolut,Unidad Genet, Cra 7A 43-82, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Plese, Tinka] Fdn AIUNAU, Medellin, Colombia; [Shostell, Joseph Mark] Univ Minnesota, Math Sci & Technol Dept, 2900 Univ Ave, Crookston, MN 56716 USA",,"Ruiz-Garcia, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Lab Genet Poblac Biol Evolut,Unidad Genet, Cra 7A 43-82, Bogota, DC, Colombia.",mruizgar@yahoo.es,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2020.0,27,3,,,,461,482,,10.1007/s10914-019-09465-w,,,,,,,,WOS:000555547100007,

Despite the progress, large parts of the continent continue to be at risk of malaria transmission, especially in northern South America. The objectives of this study were to assess the risk of malaria transmission and vector exposure in northern South America using multi-criteria decision analysis. Methods: The risk of malaria transmission and vector exposure in northern South America was assessed using multi-criteria decision analysis, in which expert opinions were taken on the key environmental and population risk factors. Results: Results from our risk maps indicated areas of moderate-to-high risk along rivers in the Amazon basin, along the coasts of the Guianas, the Pacific coast of Colombia and northern Colombia, in parts of Peru and Bolivia and within the Brazilian Amazon. When validated with occurrence records for malaria, An. darlingi, An. albimanus and An. nuneztovari s.l., t-test results indicated that risk scores at occurrence locations were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than a control group of geographically random points. Conclusion: In this study, we produced risk maps based on expert opinion on the spatial representation of risk of potential vector exposure and malaria transmission. The findings provide information to the public health decision maker/policy makers to give additional attention to the spatial planning of effective vector control measures. Therefore, as the region tackles the challenge of malaria elimination, prioritizing areas for interventions by using spatially accurate, high-resolution (1 km or less) risk maps may guide targeted control and help reduce the disease burden in the region.","[Alimi, Temitope O.] Univ Miami, Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Fuller, Douglas O.; Stoler, Justin B.] Univ Miami, Dept Geog & Reg Studies, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Herrera, Socrates V.; Arevalo-Herrera, Myriam] Ctr Invest Cient aucaseco, Cali, Colombia; [Herrera, Socrates V.; Arevalo-Herrera, Myriam] Univ Valle, Fac Hlth, Cali, Colombia; [Quinones, Martha L.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Publ Hlth, Bogota, Colombia; [Stoler, Justin B.; Beier, John C.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA",,"Alimi, TO (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",t.alimi@umiami.edu,,,,,,,18,18,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 3,2016.0,16,,,,,,,221,10.1186/s12889-016-2902-7,,,,,,,,WOS:000371865800001,

However, the spatial resolution of MODIS bands 3-7 (i.e., 500 m) is coarser than that of bands 1 and 2 (i.e., 250 m), and may be too coarse for a large number of applications. In this paper, a new geostatistical approach based on area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK) is proposed for downscaling coarse spatial resolution bands 3-7 such as to produce a complete set of MODIS images at 250 m.ATPRK takes advantages of the fine spatial resolution information in bands 1 and 2 by regression modeling, and uses area-to-point kriging to downscale the coarse residuals from the regression. ATPRK was compared to four existing methods, including the principal component analysis, wavelets, high-pass filter and kriging with external drift (RED) methods for downscaling in two experiments on MODIS data from the Brazilian Amazon. Both visual and quantitative evaluations (in terms of the root mean square error, correlation coefficient, relative global-dimensional synthesis error, universal image quality index, spectral angle mapper and spectral information divergence) showed that ATPRK produced sharpened images with the greatest quality. In addition, ATPRK perfectly preserved the spectral properties of the original coarse data and was faster than KED. The results reveal the great potential of ATPRK applied to MODIS data for a wide variety of applications, including global monitoring of deforestation. The ATPRK proposed in this paper is an entirely new image fusion approach based on a new conceptualization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In laboratory experiments, the mean delta D of methane emitted from Pinus ponderosa needle combustion (delta D-CH4(bb)) was -233 +/- 2 parts per thousand. In Brazilian fires, delta D-CH4(bb) was -210 +/- 16 parts per thousand. The measured D/H of the fuel biomass ranged from -59 to -125 parts per thousand and indicated a significant hydrogen isotope fractionation (epsilon(BURN)(D)) during combustion. For the laboratory experiments, epsilon(BURN)(D) (=(D/H)(CH4)/(D/H)(Biomass)-1)1000 = -124 parts per thousand and in the field studies, epsilon(BURN)(D) ranged from -130 to -180 parts per thousand. These results contrast those for delta(13)C which showed no fractionation during combustion, consistent with earlier studies. The measurements presented here suggest that a relatively narrow range exists for the delta D of CH4 emitted from biomass burning on a global scale and that delta D is an independent tracer for atmospheric CH4. Combining delta D-CH4(bb) = -210 parts per thousand with literature values for the strength and delta D of the major CH4 sources, we estimate a delta D for the global CH4 source of -283 +/- 13 parts per thousand. This result provides a constraint for the D/H kinetic isotope effect associated with removal of atmospheric CH4 by atmospheric hydroxyl radicals.","Univ Washington, Dept Chem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; ARS, USDA, Fire Sci Lab, Missoula, MT 59807 USA",,"Snover, AK (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Marine Affairs Climate Impacts Grp, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Box 354235, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,,,,,,,41,41,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2000.0,14,1,,,,11,24,,10.1029/1999GB900075,,,,,,,,WOS:000085808900002,

The year 2010 imagery is processed in three automatic steps: segmentation, change detection and object spectral classification. The validated maps of forest cover for the years 1990 and 2000 are integrated as thematic input layer into the image segmentation and classification process for the year 2010 data. An object-based change detection technique is applied using Tasseled Cap components and spectral Euclidean distances. Objects detected as changed are classified in two steps: parametric classification based on membership functions and change vector analysis for the remaining unclassified objects. All objects identified as 'unchanged' are used as training areas for parametric classification and spectral signatures are extracted from 2010 imagery. The change vectors are defined according to the validated land cover classification of the year 2000. The segmentation approach was tested on 568 sample units spread over Brazil. The segmentation results for year 2010 demonstrated consistency with the segmentation of imagery for the period 1990-2000. The resulting overall accuracy of the automatic classification was calculated for the 281 sample units of the Brazilian Amazon biome and for 201 sample units of three more complex Brazilian biomes, Caatinga, Cerrado and Pantanal, at 92% and 91% respectively.","[Rasi, Rastislav; Beuchle, Rene; Vollmar, Michael; Achard, Frederic] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Rasi, Rastislav] Natl Forest Ctr, Forest Res Inst, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Bodart, Catherine] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Dept Forestry, Rome, Italy; [Seliger, Roman] Engn Ingn Informat Spa, Rome, Italy",,"Rasi, R (corresponding author), Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",rasi@nlcsk.org; rene.beuchle@jrc.ec.europa.eu; Catherine.Bodart@fao.org; roman.seliger@ext.jrc.ec.europa.eu; frederic.achard@jrc.ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,21,23,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2013.0,6,1,,,,66,73,,10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2217733,,,,,,,,WOS:000316471600008,

The temporal variability is investigated at each spatial grid by utilizing 25-a moving windows from 1965-2004 and visualized through plots of the slope of the regression line in addition to its quality measure (R-2). The Poisson-generalized Pareto (Poisson-GP) model, which is a peaks over threshold (POT) approach, is applied to weekly precipitation maxima residuals based on the 95%-quantile threshold, while daily data are utilized to analyze the number of consecutive daily extremes and daily extremes in a month based on the 99%-quantile threshold. Using the Poisson-GP model, we compute parameters of the GP distribution, return levels (RL) and a new measure called the precipitation extremes volatility index (PEVI). The PEVI measures the variability of extremes and is expressed as a ratio of return levels. From 1965-2004, the PEVI shows increasing trends in the Amazon basin except eastern parts, few parts of the Brazilian highlands, north-west Venezuela including Caracas, north Argentina, Uruguay, Rio De Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Asuncion, and Cayenne. Catingas, few parts of the Brazilian highlands, Sao Paulo and Cayenne experience increasing number of consecutive 2- and 3-days extremes from 1965-2004.

This holds particularly true inasmuch as the incorporation of land through settler colonisation after Latin American countries' independence - mainly in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Brazil - became one of the key instruments for opening up and developing areas, for geostrategic securing, and for economic valorisation of hinterland spaces discursively framed as free of settlements and populations. Until the mid-20th century the regional focus of Brazilian agro- frontiers had been on Southern Brazil. Afterwards, frontier regions gradually moved towards the wide peripheries of the Middle West and the Amazon region. Today it becomes clear that the founding myth of frontier success stories is not reproducible under the contradictory framework conditions of globalization and global change, of sustainability and regional development discourses, or between market logics and environmental governance. The three case studies analysed in this contribution represent different phases of frontier development and of the spatial shift in Brazilian frontier regions. Individual framework conditions and different development paths mark their socio-spatial development; nevertheless, connections are visible in what concerns the migration history of actors and the interregional networks that exist up to the present day. The goal of the paper is 1) to analyse the framework conditions of frontier development by applying the lifecycle approach, and 2) to assess the possibilities of identifying tipping points in regional development through an historical perspective.","[Coy, Martin; Klingler, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innsbruck, Austria; [Kohlhepp, Gerd] Univ Tubingen, Geog Inst, Tubingen, Germany",,"Coy, M (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innsbruck, Austria.",Martin.Coy@uibk.ac.at; michael.klingler@uibk.ac.at; gerd.kohlhepp@t-online.de,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,30,,,,,,,,10.4000/confins.11683,,,,,,,,WOS:000404785000005,

These simulations have focused on both abstract and real-world examples in which the actions and interactions of a collection of agents, representing individuals, households, or organizations, determine the overall patterns of land-use change produced by the simulations. In these applications, the specific attributes and the model of decision making contained within the agents is typically derived from the theoretical foundation driving the development of the simulation. Clearly, the output produced by these simulations is heavily influenced by a number of factors including the individual decision making mechanisms of the agents, the attributes of individual agents, the heterogeneity of the population of agents, and the level of interaction between agents. This paper outlines some recent work with the LUCITA simulation system, an agent based model of land use change in the Altamira region of the Brazilian Amazon. Rapid deforestation of the Amazon in the past few decades has resulted in a great deal of concern as a result, in part, of losses to biodiversity and and the role of the Amazon as a global carbon sink. While the factors influencing land use change in the Amazon are fairly clear at the regional level, the factors operating at local levels are more difficult to understand. Agent based simulations that focus on human-environment interactions, are ideally suited for exploring the factors that affect land use change. This study focuses on a region of the Amazon rainforest along the Transamazon highway west of Altamira, Brazil. Since the construction of the highway in 1970 and the subsequent settling of the land by families developing household farms on plots with an average size of 100 hectares, this region has experienced rapid and profound change. Numerous studies in the region have linked land use change to local factors, such as household demographics and soil quality, and regional factors, such as commodity prices, government credit policies, and inflation. In an effort to disentangle the relative influence of some of these factors on land use change, an agent based simulation was developed to represent the human and natural systems of the region. In this simulation, household agents must make land use decisions based on their own characteristics and those of the local socioeconomic and natural environment. This paper describes the structure of the LUCITA simulation system, while focusing on the influence of household capital resources and the demographic characteristics of household cohorts on the resulting patterns of land use change produced by the model. Three sets of simulations were run in which the capital resources of the household agents were set to low, average, and high levels. The output form these three scenarios, recorded as trend in land use over time and patterns of land use quantified by landscape metrics, were compared. With increasing levels of available household capital, household moved away from growing annuals, to growing combinations of perennials and pasture, resulting in a more complex landscape. The results raise a series of questions for future research within the region.","Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",,"Deadman, P (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",pjdeadma@fes.uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2005.0,,,,,,120,126,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290114100016,

Based on our model's results, we estimate that, over the past 15 years, the total carbon storage has increased by 3.1 Pg C (+ 2%), with a 1.9-Pg C (+2%) increase in vegetation carbon and a 1.2-Pg C (+4%) increase in reactive soil organic carbon. The modelled results indicate that the largest relative changes in net carbon storage have occurred in tropical deciduous forests, but that the largest absolute changes in net carbon storage have occurred in the moist and wet forests of the Basin. 3 Our results show that the strength of interannual variations in net carbon storage of undisturbed ecosystems in the Amazon Basin varies from a carbon source of 0.2 Pg C/year to a carbon sink of 0.7 Pg C/year. Precipitation, especially the amount received during the drier months, appears to be a major controller of annual net carbon storage in the Amazon Basin. Our analysis indicates further that changes in precipitation combine with changes in temperature to affect net carbon storage through influencing soil moisture and nutrient availability. 4 On average, our results suggest that the undisturbed Amazonian ecosystems accumulated 0.2 Pg C/year as a result of climate variability and increasing atmospheric CO2 over the study period. This amount is large enough to have compensated for most of the carbon losses associated with tropical deforestation in the Amazon during the same period. 5 Comparisons with empirical data indicate that climate variability and CO2 fertilization explain most of the variation in net carbon storage for the undisturbed ecosystems. Our analyses suggest that assessment of the regional carbon budget in the tropics should be made over at least one cycle of El Nino-Southern Oscillation because of interannual climate variability. Our analyses also suggest that proper scaling of the site-specific and subannual measurements of carbon fluxes to produce Basin-wide flux estimates must take into account seasonal and spatial variations in net carbon storage.","Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ Alaska, US Geol Survey, Alaska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA",,"Tian, H (corresponding author), Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",htian@mbl.edu,,,,,,,80,94,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2000.0,9,4,,,,315,335,,10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00198.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000089055400005,

In this context, the persistence of arrow-making, although threatened by the spread of shotguns, is remarkable. During ethnoarchaeological work conducted between 2005 and 2009, we have been able to observe that the everyday making and use of arrows cannot be explained in neither functional nor symbolic terms alone. From our observations, we conclude that making and using arrows is indissolubly woven with the self of Awa men and, for that reason, we consider that only a relational-ontological approach can help us understand the deep relationship between men and arrows.

Radar echoes in the continental subtropics tend to be of an intensely convective nature, especially at the eastern foothills of the Andes where diurnally forced deep convective cells of small horizontal scale form when moist low-level flow is driven toward the foothills in connection with a midlatitude disturbance. As the disturbance moves east over the La Plata basin, nocturnal convective systems of larger horizontal scale with wide stratiform regions occur in a zone of general convergence. Precipitation in the continental tropics is generally produced by convective systems with greater stratiform composition. At the northeastern foothills of the central Andes, radar echoes of nocturnal convective systems of medium to large horizontal scale occur where moist low-level flow is lifted over the foothills. Growth of systems to large size is inhibited by daytime divergence at the foothills. Over the Amazon basin, daytime systems are also smaller than nocturnal systems. Radar echoes of precipitation over the Brazilian Highlands are generally smaller in horizontal scale, more convective, and mostly occur during the afternoon over elevated terrain. In the oceanic South Atlantic convergence zone, radar echoes grow to extremely large sizes. They are highly stratiform in nature and occur during all times of the day except late evening when convergence is weakened as a response to continental heating.","[Romatschke, Ulrike; Houze, Robert A., Jr.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Houze, RA (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Box 351640, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",houze@uw.edu,,,,,,,39,39,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2013.0,14,1,,,,25,46,,10.1175/JHM-D-12-060.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000315363800002,

Our aim was to elucidate the phylogenetic Structure among species, using the resulting 3341 bp of DNA. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses produced similar topologies that confirm the monophyly of the genus Platyrrhinus and strongly support many previously unrecognized groups. Paraphyly of Platyrrhinus helleri and the unclear position of A brachycephalus in the clades were also apparent in the data. Our biogeographical analysis suggests a Brazilian Shield origin for Platyrrhinus, followed by subsequent radiations of lineages in the Amazon Basin and Andes.

A genetic distance analysis among major linguistic groupings and among Andean and Amazonian native populations, together with information obtained from archaeological and linguistic sources was used to generate a migration model. It is suggested that in the late Pleistocene a group of nomadic hunters entered South America through the Isthmus of Panama and split afterwards into two groups, one moving southward into the central and south Andean areas and after crossing the Colombian, Equador and Peruvian highlands to people northwestern Argentina, the open park country of east Brazil and the Argentine Pampas. The second group migrated eastwards into Venezuela and Guyana and later southward, peopling the Brazilian Amazon. Following available waterways the Amazonian Indians expanded east and west arriving probably at the eastern slopes of the Andes some 3,500 years ago.

We show that if an EIA is chosen based on the attempt to maximize the financial bottom line, it raises ethical issues both from a consequentialist perspective by involving negative consequences for various stakeholder groups, and from a deontological perspective by not complying with relevant rules, guidelines, and principles. The two ethical perspectives hence reveal where the consortium faces impediments to a genuine commitment to sustainability.

It reviews the existing knowledge on the role of smallholders in rural development, and then contrasts this with the major insights gained from the studies presented in this Special Issue. The paper shows that while there is opportunity to more actively engage smallholders in local development and environmental protection of tropical America, this requires major changes in policy design and implementation. Within the prevailing policy frameworks only a smaller proportion of smallholder families can become economically successful, providing they receive the right support. If policy frameworks are better adapted to the needs and capacities of smallholders, their role in regional sustainable development can be significantly boosted. Whether such a shift of the policy framework is likely in a world where relevant policy mechanisms are dominated by decision makers representing the interests of the societies in urban and developed contexts is an open question. The fact that also these societies will be increasingly faced with the severe effects of climate change, poverty migration, financial crises and food insecurity give grounds for a cautious optimism that more integrative approaches to rural development will be pursued that put smallholders of tropical America and elsewhere, and nature at the centre.","[Pokorny, B.] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [De Jong, W.] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Integrated Area Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",,"Pokorny, B (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",benno.pokorny@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de; dejongwil@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2015.0,17,,,1,,1,19,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000351672700001,

Unravelling the influence of human presence on these forests is fundamental to our understanding of the biodiversity, ecosystem function, and service-providing potential. Human presence in these tropical rainforests dates back 13,000 years, and the impacts of this presence are hotly debated. Some authors suggest persistent effects of pre-Columbian plant domestication on current Amazonian forest composition. Other authors suggest that post-Columbian influence on forest composition is orders of magnitude higher than that of pre-Columbian times. Evidence from remote sensing has become increasingly useful as a way to help settle these debates. Here we review past, current, and future uses of remote sensing technology to detect human infrastructure in the Amazon and other Neotropical forests over the several historical periods of human presence, from archaeological to post-modern societies. We define human presence in terms of activities that left behind a footprint, such as settlements, earth-mounds, roads, use of timber and fuelwood, agriculture, soil, etc. Lastly, we discuss opportunities and challenges for the use of remote sensing to provide data and information necessary to expand our understanding of the history of human occupation in the Neotropical forests, and how this human occupation might affect biodiversity. There have been many recent applications of remote sensing to the detection of Pre-Columbian human infrastructure, from visual inspection of aerial photographs over deforested sites to uses of LiDAR on airborne and UAV platforms to detect infrastructure and smaller settlements under the canopy. Similar efforts are yet to be conducted for the Post-Columbian period, especially during the colonization and imperialism periods. Finally, our knowledge of human impacts in the modern era (20th and 21st centuries) is not-surprisingly more extensive. Remote sensing is still under-used and extremely useful for this type of application, and new missions might provide solutions that were unavailable before. Yet systematic ground surveys are irreplaceable, and detection accuracies of human presence from the combination of remote sensing and ground surveys need to be improved. It is vital therefore to understand how Neotropical forest biodiversity has developed in the presence of people in the past, the implications of this for predicting future directions of change in the Amazon and elsewhere.","[Santos, Maria J.] Univ Zurich, Univ Res Prior Program Global Change & Biodivers, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Santos, Maria J.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Disney, Mathias] UCL, Dept Geog, Off 113,Pearson Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Disney, Mathias] NCEO, NERC, Off 113,Pearson Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Disney, Mathias] UCL, Dept Geog, Off 113,Pearson Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Chave, Jerome] UPS, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol EDB, CNRS, UMR 5174,IRD, Batiment 4R1 118,Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France",,"Santos, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Univ Res Prior Program Global Change & Biodivers, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.; Santos, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",maria.j.santos@geo.uzh.ch; mathias.disney@ucl.ac.uk; jerome.chave@univ-tlse3.fr,,,,,,,6,7,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2018.0,10,10,,,,,,1593,10.3390/rs10101593,,,,,,,,WOS:000448555800093,

In order to interpret groundwater H-3 concentrations in Cochabamba Valley, where no historical record of H-3 concentrations in rainfall exists, a reconstructed H-3 precipitation record is developed. The record of H-3 concentrations in precipitation is fairly extensive in the Amazon Basin and this record was extrapolated to the neighbouring Cochabamba Valley, Tritium concentrations in rainfall have been observed to increase under natural conditions with increasing latitude and with increasing distance from the ocean. By considering these trends, a linear relationship for increasing H-3 concentration in precipitation is developed, based on data from the Amazon Basin, that realistically predicts regional H-3 distributions from the northeast Brazilian coast to Cuzco, Peru. This H-3 precipitation record is then extrapolated to the Cochabamba Valley and, after correction for radiogenic decay, is used to interpret trends in groundwater H-3 concentrations within the valley. The groundwater flow system in one of the principal alluvial fans, which serves as an important groundwater resource for the city, is studied in detail. Tritium concentrations drop from approximately 8-10 tritium units (TU) in the recharge area to concentrations below the detection limit of 0.8 TU further out in the valley. Groundwater velocities of approximately 0.3 to 0.9 m d(-1) are estimated from distributions of groundwater H-3 concentrations along the alluvial fan with the use of the reconstructed precipitation H-3 record. Regional characteristics of the groundwater flow system are discussed with respect to future development and protection of the groundwater resources.","UNIV WATERLOO,WATERLOO CTR GROUNDWATER RES,WATERLOO,ON N2J 1K5,CANADA; UNIV WATERLOO,DEPT EARTH SCI,WATERLOO,ON N2L 3G1,CANADA",,,,,,,,,,7,12,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 15,1996.0,180,1-4,,,,155,172,,10.1016/0022-1694(95)02902-8,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UP76700008,

A cross site comparison reveals high differences of deforestation patterns between sites in terms of landscape configuration and complexity, of distribution and isolation of patches, and of degree of fragmentation. And the monitoring of landscape dynamic on a Brazilian site shows tremendous changes over the last 25 years and landscape pattern indices help to identify trends and quantify landscape changes: percentage forest decreases with forest cover, while Matheron index increases with fragmentation of landscape and fractal index increases with complexity of landscape pattern.

In this study, we implement a complex networks-based methodology to track individual fires over space and time.

We analyse the interannual variability in the number and spatial patterns of extreme forest fires in years with diverse climatic conditions and anthropogenic pressure to examine potential synergies between climate and anthropogenic drivers. We observe that major droughts, that increase forest flammability, co-occur with high extreme fire years but also that it is fundamental to consider anthropogenic activities to understand the distribution of extreme fires. Deforestation fires, fires escaping from managed lands, and other types of forest degradation and fragmentation provide the ignition sources for fires to ignite in the forests. We find that all extreme forest fires identified are located within a 0.5-km distance from forest edges, and up to 56% of them are within a 1-km distance from roads (which increases to 73% within 5 km), showing a strong correlation that defines spatial patterns of extreme fires.","[Cano-Crespo, Ana; Thonicke, Kirsten] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Cano-Crespo, Ana] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Traxl, Dominik] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany",,"Cano-Crespo, A (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.; Cano-Crespo, A (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany.",canocrespoana@gmail.com,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2021.0,230,14-15,,,,3033,3044,,10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00164-3,,JUN 2021,,,,,,WOS:000665765800001,

This has been mostly done by detecting differences in a time series of high resolution data. However, the interpretation of the images and the detection of change is cumbersome and expensive. Furthermore, the area covered by a high resolution image is relatively small and only available on a monthly bases. This work investigates if detected fire of the low resolution (AVHRR) sensor can be used as a quick and inexpensive way of locating areas of rapid forest cover change. It tests the hypothesis that vegetation fires, as detected by earth orbiting satellites, are a reliable indicator of hot spots of deforestation in tropical South America. Fine spatial resolution satellite data were used to measure the deforestation that occurred in the mid 1990s in 41 sites spread across the tropical forests of South America. These data were then compared to the number of fires occurring in these sites, as detected by the NOAA-AVHRR satellite between April 1992 and December 1993. At the individual site level, 25 of the test sites showed a significant statistical relationship between the fires and the deforestation occurring in the following years. A further 6 sites showed neither fire activity nor significant deforestation. When aggregated to the regional level, only the set of sites lying in relatively dry areas with the same land use practices (located in Brazil) showed a significant correlation between fire and deforestation. This correlation enabled us to produce a map of high deforestation risk occurring in 1992 in the Brazilian Amazon, which showed close correspondence to the actual deforestation fronts of the year 1992.

Due to their low fecundity and complex social organization, large primates are often the first tropical forest vertebrates to be extirpated by hunting. Large primates are important seed dispersers and the only dispersal vectors of many large-seeded plants, leading to concerns that primate-dispersed trees will succumb to large-scale recruitment failure wherever they co-occur with overhunting. We used a field experiment in a remote, nonhunted region of the western Brazilian Amazon to test how the seedling recruitment success of a primate-dispersed Sapotaceae tree (Manilkara bidentata) is affected by distance from parent trees, protection from vertebrate seed predators, and gastro-intestinal seed cleaning associated with passage through frugivorous vertebrates. Only seed cleaning significantly increased the rate of seedling recruitment. Janzen-Connell effects have been widely purported as the central mechanism for recruitment failure, but our results suggest that for many tropical forest plant species Janzen-Connell effects are a second-order effect that acts once seeds have been successfully cleaned of fruit pulp by gut treatment. As an illustration of the relative importance of the sheer quantity of seeds ingested by woolly monkeys (Lagothrix cana), we further estimate the density and dispersal services provided by a complete primate assemblage to show that L cana cleans and disperses nearly one million seeds per km(2) per 24-day Manilkara fruiting season, amounting to over 71% of the seed dispersal services provided by the entire primate assemblage. The disperser vacuum in the absence of L. cane greatly reduces the quantity of cleaned seeds deposited on the forest floor. For similar fleshy-fruited species where gut passage greatly increases survival, a simple lack of redundancy in seed consumption may be the primary driver of recruitment failure resulting from large-primate extirpation due to overhunting, with Janzen-Connell effects secondarily influencing recruitment success as a function of either dispersal distance or seed density.

Cattle ranching and soy expansion constitute the major drivers of deforestation, both through direct conversion and indirectly by land use displacement. However, deforestation rates decreased significantly after the implementation of the action plan to prevent and control deforestation in 2004. The aim of this study is to quantify the contribution of cattle and soy production with deforestation before and after the implementation of the action plan in the two states Mato Grosso and Para along the BR-163. Specifically, we aim to empirically test for land use displacement processes from soy expansion in Mato Grosso to the deforestation frontier between 2001 and 2012. First, we calculated the relationships between deforestation rate and the change in cattle head and planted soy area respectively for the BR-163 region. Second, we estimated different panel regression models to test the association between processes of land use displacement. Our results indicate a close linkage between cattle ranching and deforestation along the BR-163 between 2001 and 2004. Soy expansion in Mato Grosso was significantly associated with deforestation during this period. However, these relations have diminished after the implementation of the action plan to control and prevent deforestation. With the decrease in deforestation rates in 2005, cattle ranching and deforestation were not directly linked, nor was soy expansion in Mato Grosso and deforestation at the forest frontier. Our analysis hence suggests that there was a close coupling of processes and spatial displacement until 2004 and a decoupling has taken place following the political interventions. These findings improve the understanding of land use displacement processes in Brazil and the methods offer potential for exploring similar processes in different regions of the world.

In so doing, the article argues that what we observe today represents the consequence of conflicting development strategies, brought about by shifting national priorities that were influenced, in part, by international pressures. The article makes this argument by first presenting an overview of development strategies pursued since the mid-twentieth century, followed by a description of shifting national priorities linked to pressures from the international community regarding indigenous rights and environmental concern. Finally, this article presents a GIS-based case study focused on the state of Par, demonstrating the spatial articulation of contradictory policies and showing the overlap and conflict between competing interests, These spaces of conflict are supported by actual accounts of disputes at the local level.","Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Geog, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",,"Simmons, CS (corresponding author), Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Geog, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",cynthia.simmons@cmich.edu,,,,,,,34,34,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2002.0,54,2,,,,241,258,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000175693000009,

From a total of 47 species (27 families), the most abundant were: Cathorops sp. (Ariidae), Colomesus psittacus (Tetraodontidae), Hexanematichthys herzbergii (Ariidae), Pseudauchenipterus nodosus (Auchenipteridae), the shrimp Fenneropenaeus subtilis (Penaeidae), Anchovia clupeoides (Engraulidae), Mugil spp. (Mugilidae), and Anableps anableps (Anablepidae). Diversity H' was low (0.9). Mean values If fish density and biomass ( +/-S.E.) were 0.2 +/- 0.1 fish m(-3) and 2.6 +/- 0.7 m(-3) g m(-2), or 1.4 +/- 0.4 respectively. The high proportion of juvenile fish (87%) and shrimps point to the importance of intertidal mangrove creeks for fish nurseries. The number of species was highest at spring tide-night and lowest at neap tide-day. Evenness J' was lowest at spring tide-night when more rare species entered and dominant species increased in quantitative proportions. Four different species assemblages were identified as being triggered by factor combinations such as tide and time of day: spring tide-night, spring tide-day, neap tide-night and neap tide-day. High-water level influenced the species assemblages, but salinity and water temperature did not. Abundance of 14 Species Correlated positively with the high-water level. Strong spring tides yielded extraordinary high nekton catches, suggesting that high-water level is an important parameter in the tidal migration of fish. Most fish entered the mangrove to feed. Predation pressure was considered to be low because of the presence of only a few, mainly juvenile predators. Beach seining in the subtidal parts at low water revealed a high biomass (30 +/- 14 g m(-2)). Larger fish withdraw to depressions, small fish and juvenile shrimp were abundant near the shallow banks, suggesting inter- and intraspecific splitting of the migration routes when returning from the intertidal zone at ebb tide. To cover the entire short-term range of tidal ichthyofauna responses, a sample design should consider the spring/neap and the day/night cycle.","Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, ZMT, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Marine Res Inst, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",,"Krumme, U (corresponding author), Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, ZMT, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",uwe.krumme@zmt-bremen.de,,,,,,,71,76,,,,,,,,,,,APR-JUN,2004.0,17,2,,,,215,229,,10.1051/alr:2004019,,,,,,,,WOS:000222591000015,

Successes in Europe, the United States, and Argentina convinced ranchers, investors, and animal scientists that these could be applied in the tropical Americas with ease. This assumption contributed to a wave of foreign ranching investment in semi-tropical Mato Grosso, Brazil, beginning in the early twentieth century. However, such a view failed to consider the specific characteristics of such environments and led to difficulties for several ventures and a re-evaluation of the relationship between ecosystems and the type of ranching appropriate to them. Ultimately, local Brazilian practice and experimentation proved more successful in tropical and semi-tropical Brazil, forcing foreign ranching concerns to adapt their techniques. Following the logic of earlier decades, more recently cattle-raising practices developed in Mato Grosso and similar regions have been applied in the tropical Amazon, resulting in widespread ecological devastation. The uneven experiences of foreign entrepreneurs in Mato Grosso offer valuable lessons for understanding the application of modernization technologies to diverse ecosystems; such knowledge can lead to a more sustainable approach to meat production.","No Kentucky Univ, Highland Hts, KY 41099 USA",,"Wilcox, RW (corresponding author), No Kentucky Univ, Highland Hts, KY 41099 USA.",,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,SUM,2008.0,82,3,,,,366,392,,10.3098/ah.2008.82.3.366,,,,,,,,WOS:000258075000004,

In the case of soybean production, increasing trade between South American farmers and consumers in Asia and Europe has facilitated soybean expansion in the Amazon, Chaco, and Cerrado biomes. While these telecouplings have been well documented, there is little understanding of how quality preferences influence trade patterns and supply chains, incentivizing or discouraging particular land use practices. In this study we provide empirical evidence that Brazil's continued production of non-genetically modified (GM) soybeans has increased its competitive advantage in European countries with preferences against GM foods. Brazil's strong trade relationship with European consumers has facilitated an upgrading of the soybean supply chain. Upgraded soybean supply chains create new conservation opportunities by allowing farmers to differentiate their products based on environmental quality in order to access premiums in niche markets in Europe. These interactions between GM preferences, trade flows, and supply chain structure help to explain why Brazilian soybean farmers have adopted environmental certification programs on a larger scale than Argentinian, Bolivian, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan soybean producers.","[Garrett, Rachael D.] Harvard Univ, Sustainabil Sci Program, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Garrett, Rachael D.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rueda, Ximena] Univ Los Andes, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm & Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Garrett, RD (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sustainabil Sci Program, 79 JFK St,Box 81, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rachael_garrett@hks.harvard.edu,,,,,,,57,58,,,,,,,,,,,OCT-DEC,2013.0,8,4,,,,,,44055,10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/044055,,,,,,,,WOS:000329604900062,

Its ability to amalgamate with gold and silver are used in mining these precious metals and as a dental restorative. Its toxic properties have been exploited for medications, preservatives, antiseptics, and pesticides. For these reasons there have been many industrial uses of mercury, and occupational exposures of workers and industrial emissions and effluents contaminating air, water, soil, and ultimately food chains have long been a matter of great public health concern.

It has the largest mammal diversity (more than 530 described species) with many yet to be discovered and cataloged. Very few sites have been adequately surveyed, and local lists are usually incomplete, which makes for knowledge gaps that hamper conservation and management initiatives and regional analyses. According to the Brazilian Institute for the Environment (IBAMA), 66 species are threatened, and the World Conservation Union lists 74. Primates, mostly Atlantic Forest endemics, are the most endangered group (40% of the threatened taxa). Carnivores and rodents are also notable members of the lists. Twenty-nine percent of listed species are marine, 18% occur in the Atlantic Forest; 13% in the Pampas, 12% in the Cerrado, 11% in the Pantanal, 7% in the Amazon, and 6% in the Caatinga. Human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to land mammals in Brazil, and large- and medium-sized mammals are hunted. The major threat to small mammals is the scarcity of basic scientific knowledge-taxonomy, systematics, distribution, and natural history. Aquatic mammals are threatened by commercial hunting, accidental netting, long-line fisheries, chemical pollution, habitat degradation, tourism, and boat traffic. Mammal conservation has benefited from a number of recent initiatives by government and nongovernmental organizations, including legislation, nationwide initiatives to define priority areas for conservation, management plans for some threatened species, sustainable landscape planning, and new protected areas. Given the rate of habitat loss, a nationwide program of short- and long-term field surveys and increased support for natural history collections is of particularly urgency. Progress has been made toward conserving Brazilian mammals in recent years, but threats are growing fast, and conservation science must keep growing to provide the wherewithal to minimize and remove these threats.","Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Ciencias Biol, BR-29040090 Vitoria, ES, Spain; Inst Pesquisas Mata Atlantica, BR-29060420 Vitoria, ES, Spain",,"Costa, LP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Ciencias Biol, Av Marechal Campos 1468, BR-29040090 Vitoria, ES, Spain.",leonoracosta@cbm.ufes.br,,,,,,,70,92,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2005.0,19,3,,,,672,679,,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00666.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000229448100015,

MAB is the representative body of this population and has put forward the new agenda of third-generation rights. Over the years, the movement has grown into a national organization but still has not been able to enforce policies to protect the rights of dam-affected people. Since the beginning of the construction of the dam in 2011, entire communities have been displaced while an enormous contingent of workers and immigrants have moved to the area. As a result, there has been an increase in social problems, such as unemployment, drug abuse, prostitution, etc., in the urban periphery around the dam site.

The results of this study showed that HEL was the most important factor in reducing diarrhea, and the presence of a BSF was near ineffective.

Fire is used, both directly and indirectly, in Brazilian Amazonia to propagate deforestation and increase forest accessibility. Forest fragmentation, a measure of forest degradation, is also attributed to fire occurrence in the tropics. However, outside the Brazilian Legal Amazonia the role of fire in increasing accessibility and forest fragmentation is less explored. In this study, we compared fire regimes in five countries that share this tropical biome in the most north-westerly part of the Amazon Basin (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil). We analysed spatial differences in the timing of peak fire activity and in relation to proximity to roads and rivers using 12 years of MODIS active fire detections. We also distinguished patterns of fire in relation to forest fragmentation by analysing fire distance to the forest edge as a measure of fragmentation for each country. We found significant hemispheric differences in peak fire occurrence with the highest number of fires in the south in 2005 vs. 2007 in the north. Despite this, both hemispheres are equally affected by fire. We also found difference in peak fire occurrence by country. Fire peaked in February in Colombia and Venezuela, whereas it peaked in September in Brazil and Peru, and finally Ecuador presented two fire peaks in January and October. We confirmed the relationship between fires and forest fragmentation for all countries and also found significant differences in the distance between the fire and the forest edge for each country. Fires were associated with roads and rivers in most countries. These results can inform land use planning at the regional, national and subnational scales to minimize the contribution of road expansion and subsequent access to the Amazonian natural resources to fire occurrence and the associated deforestation and carbon emissions.","[Armenteras, Dolors; Sebastian Barreto, Joan] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Biol, Lab Ecol Paisaje & Modelac Ecosistemas ECOLMOD, Edif 421,Of 223, Bogota, Colombia; [Tabor, Karyn] 2Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Molowny-Horas, Roberto; Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Molowny-Horas, Roberto; Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Unitat Ecol, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain",,"Armenteras, D (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Biol, Lab Ecol Paisaje & Modelac Ecosistemas ECOLMOD, Edif 421,Of 223, Bogota, Colombia.",darmenterasp@unal.edu.co,,,,,,,23,24,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 6,2017.0,14,11,,,,2755,2765,,10.5194/bg-14-2755-2017,,,,,,,,WOS:000402797200002,

Riverine input represents an important source of DOM to the oceans, yet much remains to be learned about the fate of the DOM linking terrestrial to oceanic carbon cycles through rivers at the global scale. Here we use ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to identify 184 molecular formulae that are indicators of riverine inputs (referred to as t-Peaks) and to track their distribution in the deep North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. The t-Peaks were found to be enriched in the Amazon River, to be highly correlated with known tracers of terrigenous input, and to be observed in all samples from four different rivers characterized by vastly different landscapes and vegetation coverage spanning equatorial (Amazon and Congo), subtropical (Altamaha), and Arctic (Kolyma) regions. Their distribution reveals that terrigenous organic matter is injected into the deep ocean by the global meridional overturning circulation, indicating that a fraction of the terrigenous DOM introduced by rivers contributes to the DOM pool observed in the deep ocean and to the storage of terrigenous organic carbon. This novel molecular approach can be used to further constrain the transfer of DOM from land to sea, especially considering that Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer analysis is becoming increasingly frequent in studies characterizing the molecular composition of DOM in lakes, rivers, and the ocean.","[Medeiros, Patricia M.; Seidel, Michael; Yager, Patricia L.; Miller, William L.] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Seidel, Michael; Niggemann, Jutta; Dittmar, Thorsten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Res Grp Marine Geochem, ICBM MPI Bridging Grp, Oldenburg, Germany; [Spencer, Robert G.

We investigate whether it still exists in the CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5) models and, if so, what causes these biases? Our evaluation of historical simulations shows that some models still underestimate rainfall over Amazonia. During the dry season, both convective and large-scale precipitation is underestimated in most models. GFDL-ESM2M and IPSL notably show more pentads with no rainfall. During the wet season, large-scale precipitation is still underestimated in most models. In the dry and transition seasons, models with more realistic moisture convergence and surface evapotranspiration generally have more realistic rainfall totals. In some models, overestimates of rainfall are associated with the adjacent tropical and eastern Pacific ITCZs. However, in other models, too much surface net radiation and a resultant high Bowen ratio appears to cause underestimates of rainfall. During the transition season, low pre-seasonal latent heat, high sensible flux, and a weaker influence of cold air incursions contribute to the dry bias. About half the models can capture, but overestimate, the influences of teleconnection. Based on a simple metric, HadGEM2-ES outperforms other models especially for surface conditions and atmospheric circulation. GFDL-ESM2M has the strongest dry bias presumably due to its overestimate of moisture divergence, induced by overestimated ITCZs in adjacent oceans, and reinforced by positive feedbacks between reduced cloudiness, high Bowen ratio and suppression of rainfall during the dry season, and too weak incursions of extratropical disturbances during the transition season.","[Yin, Lei; Fu, Rong; Dickinson, Robert E.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Shevliakova, Elena] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Shevliakova, Elena] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Yin, L (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, 1 Univ Stn C1100, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",yin@utexas.edu,,,,,,,149,150,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2013.0,41,11-12,,,,3127,3143,,10.1007/s00382-012-1582-y,,,,,,,,WOS:000327080400018,

While the preceding decade has seen a tremendous improvement in the ability to monitor forest disturbances from space, large-scale (spatial and temporal) forest monitoring systems have almost universally relied on optical satellite data from the Landsat program, whose effectiveness is limited in tropical regions with frequent cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can penetrate clouds and have been utilized in forest mapping applications since the early 1990s, but only recently has SAR data been widely available on a scale sufficient to facilitate pan-tropical selective logging detection systems. Here, a detailed selective logging dataset from three lowland tropical forest regions in the Brazilian Amazon was used to assess the effectiveness of SAR data from Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) for monitoring tropical selective logging. We built Random Forests models aimed at classifying pixel-based differences between logged and unlogged areas. In addition, we used the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm to assess if a dense time series of Sentinel-1 imagery displayed recognizable shifts in pixel values after selective logging. In general, Random Forests classification with SAR data (Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) performed poorly, having high commission and omission errors for logged observations. This suggests little to no difference in pixel-based metrics between logged and unlogged areas for these sensors, particularly at lower logging intensities. In contrast, the Sentinel-1 time series analyses indicated that areas under higher intensity selective logging ( 5% in unlogged forest. Overall our results suggest that SAR data can be used in time series analyses to detect tropical selective logging at high intensity logging locations ( 20 m3 ha- 1) within the Amazon.","[Hethcoat, Matthew G.; Quegan, Shaun] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England; [Hethcoat, Matthew G.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Hethcoat, Matthew G.; Edwards, David P.] Univ Sheffield, Grantham Ctr Sustainable Futures, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Carreiras, Joao M.

Even the worst drought in more than 100 years (2010) produced a flat clearing profile from 2009-2010, an unexpected result, since dry periods usually have clearing spikes. While deforestation continues throughout the tropics (and Amazonia), and the recent change in Brazil's Forest Code has produced a modest increase in deforestation, there are significant processes that are slowing clearing and fostering woodland recovery. This paper outlines the multiplicities and interdisciplinarities of political ecologies, policies, politics scientific approaches and technologies that have moderated forest conversion and shaped Amazonia's unusual, and unusually effective development and conservation conjunctures in Brazil's post-authoritarian period. New institutional framings, ideologies, political decentralization, globalizations and an expanded arena for new social movements and civil society provided the context for this transformation. Changing environmental institutions, discourses and the relatively redistributive social pact that underpinned President Ignacio (Lula) da Silva's administration had a significant role in promoting more resilient land uses, monitoring, compliance and new markets, while regional social movements and national and international commodity boycotts affected more damaging ones. Finally, other forms of payment for environmental services, such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and REDD+ are changing the value of standing forests. This paper describes how complex interdisciplinarities shaped the politics, policies and practices that slowed forest clearing. However, Amazonia's politics are extremely dynamic: destabilizing processes, violence and indifferent national leadership could still reverse this remarkable turnaround.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Inst Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Hecht, SB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Inst Environm, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",sbhecht@ucla.edu,,,,,,,54,57,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2012.0,39,1,,,,4,19,,10.1017/S0376892911000452,,,,,,,,WOS:000299937200002,

The government originally confiscated this substance in 1999, and the matter went to the Supreme Court, which handed down a decision favourable to the UDV in 2006. Despite the fact that this group prevailed, the agreement reveals that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) views ayahuasca not as a religious sacrament, but as a toxic and hazardous compound. This article also contextualizes this agreement in relation to the history of the UDV, which has been expanding beyond the Amazon since the 1970s. This process entailed increasing levels of institutionalization, formalization and bureaucratization. In its search for social legitimacy and legal conformity, the group has gradually shifted from its popular Amazonian origins. This process reached its peak with the current agreement with the DEA.

Dissimilarity values for all pairs of plots were then used to compare forest composition at both local (flooded vs unflooded forests) and regional scales (e.g., western vs central vs eastern Amazonia). The predominate family of trees in a large majority of Amazonian and Guianan forests (by number of stems) is either Palmae or Leguminosae (sensu latu), followed by Moraceae and Euphorbiaceae. The forests of western Amazonia are particularly rich in palms, Moraceae, and Myristicaceae, whereas those of eastern Amazonia and the Guianas are rich in Lecythidaceae and Chrysobalanaceae. Dissimilarity between sites increases with distance for both flooded and unflooded forests. The tree communities of flooded and unflooded forests within a region tended to resemble one another more closely than forests of either type resembled the homologous forests of the adjoining regions. Within Amazonia the edaphic properties of each region and its geological history are tightly interrelated. it is therefore difficult to distinguish between evolutionary and ecological interpretations of the results.","Duke Univ, Ctr Trop Conservat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Terborgh, J (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Ctr Trop Conservat, Box 90381, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",manu@acpub.duke.edu,,,,,,,152,174,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,1998.0,14,,5,,,645,664,,10.1017/S0266467498000455,,,,,,,,WOS:000077020100006,

Annual losses from mercury, which is used to amalgamate gold, are in the range of 1000 tonnes, and at advanced sites, there is the additional threat of cyanide contamination. Recent developments in The Brazilian Amazon, an area populated by 200,000 small-scale gold miners, have the potential to reduce these impacts considerably. In the locality of Garimpo Ouro Roxo, miners are presently using amalgamation and cyanidation in vat-leaching. Each cycle typically recovers 50% of the gold and lasts 20 days (per tank), consuming around 3300 kg NaCN/month. A new process has been developed and implemented in a pilot plant in this area, involving gravity concentration followed by cyanidation in a ball mill. Concentrate leaching is conducted with a PVC capsule filled with activated carbon inserted in the cyanide solution in the mill. The cycle takes less than 24 h and recovers up to 98% of the gold in the concentrate. The main advantages of wide adoption of this method, apart from a reduced gold recovery cycle and improved recovery, include possible phase out of amalgamation altogether, and marked reductions in cyanide consumption (from current 22,000 kg-980 kg annually).

Kayapo society is divided into two status groups, people who have received beautiful names from certain kin during elaborate village rituals, and those who have not. The ritual bestowal of such names counteracts fissive tendencies produced through the developmental cycle of Kayapo households. Beautiful people tend to have wider kin networks with access to greater resources and leadership roles than do ordinary commoners. These distinctions are correlated with categories of animals and forms of behavior, and reveal parallels to the socialization and death of the person. However, certain contradictions in Kayapo society are epitomized in the figure of the jaguar, an animal that embodies beauty and power as well as fierceness and bestiality. Similarly, leaders mobilize resources for the well-being of the entire community, but they are also at risk of reverting to bestial behavior and running amok. Anthropological theories of animism and perspectivism would do well to consider the more nuanced Kayapo concepts of the complex interconnections between animals and humans, the natural and the social.","[Turner, Terence] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Turner, Terence] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Turner, T (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Turner, T (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,FAL,2017.0,7,2,,,,51,70,,10.14318/hau7.2.008,,,,,,,,WOS:000417383700008,

Each case study presents parameters obtained from monitoring initial harvest entries into primary forests for planned, reduced-impact logging (RIL) and unplanned, conventional logging (CL) operations. Differences in cost definitions and data collection protocols complicate the comparative analysis, and suggest that caution is necessary in interpreting results. Given this caveat, it appears that RIL can generate competitive or superior profits relative to CL if the financial costs of wood wasted in the harvesting operation are fully accounted for. Increased operational efficiency is an important benefit of RIL, one that largely determines its cost-effectiveness relative to conventional practices. Uncertainties concerning the marginal benefits of RIL relative to familiar, profitable conventional practices pose an obstacle to broader adoption. Moreover, CL firms face few incentives to alter their operations unless they face dramatic changes in market signals. Adoption of RIL techniques as part of a long-term forest management regime faces additional challenges related to the opportunity cost of silvicultural prescriptions and timber set-asides to maintain productivity and ecosystem integrity.

Mineralogical assessment of non-traditional ores, such as mining wastes, is also an important step to consider them for near-future industries. In the Brazilian Amazon, alumina-rich clays cover the largest and most important bauxitic deposits of the region and have been considered as a possible raw material for the local cement and ceramic industry. In this work, a mineralogical evaluation of these clays (Belterra Clays) is performed using XRPD, XRF, TA, and FTIR. XRPD-Rietveld quantification confirmed that kaolinite is the main phase of the clay overburden, followed by variable contents of gibbsite and goethite and minor quantities of hematite, anatase, and quartz. The chemistry derived from Rietveld, based on stoichiometric phase compositions, presents a good correlation with the XRF data and is also supported by the TA and FTIR data.

The focus is on relational justice, defined as the way interactions between mining companies and communities are formed and managed, both in terms of how parties communicate their interests and the processes through which decisions are made. Using a case study in the Brazilian Amazon, relational justice is explored from the perspective of 'voice', 'capabilities' and 'trust' - collectively these are the elements of justice. Ethnographic methods were applied to conduct this research, and four key findings are presented. First, community-company relations are affected by insufficient understanding among local communities about mining and its social and environmental impacts. Second, elements of justice are impacted by communication processes established by the mining company to engage with local communities. Third, the participation of external actors to support communities has the potential to maximise justice by improving local community capabilities, especially in terms of improving communication and negotiation. The fourth finding was that relational justice is affected by internal organisation and community representation. We conclude by arguing that justice in the mining context can be maximised by improving access to information, and establishing participatory and inclusive process for decision making.","[Gavidia, Mirella Cobeleanschi] Univ Queensland, Ctr Social Responsibil Min, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kemp, Deanna] UQ, SMI, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",,"Gavidia, MC (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Social Responsibil Min, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2017.0,,,,,,79,89,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000431842100006,

Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has dropped by over 80 percent, a pattern mimicked elsewhere in Amazonia, and is down by more than a third in Central America. Forest resurgence - increasing forest cover in inhabited landscapes or abandoned lands - is also expanding. In Latin America, woodland cover is increasing, at least for now, more than it is being lost. These dramatic shifts suggest quite profound and rapid transformations of agrarian worlds, and imply that previous models of understanding small-farmer dynamics merit significant review centering less on field agriculture and more on emergent forest regimes, and in many ways a new, increasingly globalized economic and policy landscape that emphasizes woodlands. This paper analyzes changing deforestation drivers and the implications of forest recovery and wooded landscapes emerging through social pressure, social policy, new government agencies, governance, institutions, ideologies, markets, migration and 'neo-liberalization' of nature. These changes include an expanded, but still constrained, arena for new social movements and civil society. These point to significant structural changes, changes in tropical natures, and require reframing of the `peasant question' and the functions of rurality in the twenty-first century in light of forest dynamics.","[Hecht, Susanna B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs Reg & Int Dev & Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Hecht, Susanna B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Hecht, Susanna B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",,"Hecht, SB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs Reg & Int Dev & Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",sbhecht@ucla.edu,,,,,,,41,41,,,,,,,,,,,,2014.0,41,5,,,,877,909,,10.1080/03066150.2014.917371,,,,,,,,WOS:000342326000011,

The microbial activity was recorded microcalorimetrically as power-time lines during 24 h. The soil mass specific heat rate J(Q/S) and the cell specific heat rate J(Q/N) were calculated, and compared to the microbial population of the soil samples and to the number of microorganisms per organic carbon. Results showed an inverse hyperbolic relation between J(Q/N) and number of microorganisms of the samples, and between J(Q/N) and the number of microorganisms per organic carbon. The microcalorimetric indexes of microbial activity were affected by some other soil properties, as percent of carbon, nitrogen, and C/N ratio, as well as by the introduction of agriculture, which affected the microbial population. We believe that the cell specific heat rate can be considered as an index that indicates the efficiency of the energy utilization by soil microorganisms, similarly to the specific respiration activity. The reason of its negative correlation with the microbial density could be attributed to changes in the strategy of the energy utilization by microorganisms in soils. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, the authors examine nine years (2000-08) of historical 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo estimates across South America to advance understanding of the magnitude and sources of large-scale albedo changes. The authors use the magnitude of albedo change from the arc of deforestation along the southeastern edge of the Brazilian Amazon (+12.8%) as a benchmark for comparison. Large albedo increases (>+12.8%) were 2.2 times more prevalent than similar decreases throughout South America. Changes in surface water drove most large albedo changes that were not caused by vegetative cover change. Decreased surface water in the Santa Fe and Buenos Aires regions of Argentina was responsible for albedo increases exceeding that of the arc of deforestation in magnitude and extent. Although variations in the natural flooding regimes were likely the dominant mechanism driving changes in surface water, it is possible that human manipulations through dams and other agriculture infrastructure contributed. This study demonstrates the substantial role that landcover and surface water change can play in continental-scale albedo trends and suggests ways to better incorporate these processes into global climate models.","[Loarie, Scott R.; Asner, Gregory P.; Field, Christopher B.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lobell, David B.] Stanford Univ, Program Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Loarie, SR (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, 260 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",loarie@stanford.edu,,,,,,,33,35,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2011.0,15,,,,,,,7,10.1175/2010EI342.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000291146600001,

Study 2 (N = 283) investigated effects of both color and accent (Local vs Non-Local) on friendship and sharing decisions. Overall, there was a significant bias toward the lighter colored individual. A significant preference for local accent mitigates but does not override the color bias, except in the site characterized by both racial and accent heterogeneity. Results also vary by participant age and color. Study 3 (N = 235) reports results of an accent discrimination task that shows an overall increase in accuracy with age.

A global stratified random sample can be augmented by additional sample units within a region selected by the same stratified protocol and the resulting sample constitutes a stratified random sample of the region. Stratified sampling allows increasing the sample size in a region by a few to many additional sample units. The additional sample units can be effectively allocated to strata to reduce the standard errors of the regional estimates, even though these strata were not initially constructed for the objective of regional estimation. A complete coverage map of deforestation within the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) is used as a population to evaluate precision of regional estimates obtained by augmenting a global stratified random sample.

A deforestation event today leads to a time-delayed future release of carbon, from the eventual decay either of forest products or of slash left at the site [2]. Similarly, deforestation often does not result in the immediate loss of species, and communities may exhibit a process of relaxation to their new equilibrium over time [3]. We used a spatially explicit land cover change model [4] to reconstruct the annual rates and spatial patterns of tropical deforestation that occurred between 1950 and 2009 in the Amazon, in the Congo Basin, and across Southeast Asia. Using these patterns, we estimated the resulting gross vegetation carbon emissions [2, 5] and species losses over time [6]. Importantly, we accounted for the time lags inherent in both the release of carbon and the extinction of species. We show that even if deforestation had completely halted in 2010, time lags ensured there would still be a carbon emissions debt of at least 8.6 petagrams, equivalent to 5-10 years of global deforestation, and an extinction debt of more than 140 bird, mammal, and amphibian forest-specific species, which if paid, would increase the number of 20th-century extinctions in these groups by 120%.

We studied the relationship between land holding, land use, and inequality in a peasant community in the Peruvian Amazon where farmers practice swidden-fallow cultivation. Longitudinal data on land holding, land use, and land cover were gathered through field-level surveys ( n = 316) and household interviews ( n = 51) in 1994/1995 and 2007. Forest cover change between 1965 and 2007 was documented through interpretation of air photos and satellite imagery. We introduce the concept of land use inequality to capture differences across households in the distribution of forest fallowing and orchard raising as key land uses that affect household welfare and the sustainability of swidden-fallow agriculture. We find that land holding, land use, and forest cover distribution are correlated and that the forest today reflects social inequality a decade prior. Although initially land-poor households may catch up in terms of land holdings, their use and land cover remain impoverished. Differential land use investment through time links social inequality and forest cover. Implications are discussed for the study of forests as landscapes of inequality, the relationship between social inequality and forest composition, and the forest-poverty nexus.","[Coomes, Oliver T.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Takasaki, Yoshito] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo 1138654, Japan; [Rhemtulla, Jeanine M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",,"Coomes, OT (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,21,3,,,,,,20,10.5751/ES-08684-210320,,,,,,,,WOS:000385720400034,

Generalized linear models however, overlook the spatial component of land-use data, and its effects on statistical inference. Spatial autocorrelation may artificially reduce variance in observations, and inflate the effect size of covariates. To uncover the consequences of overlooking this spatial component, we tested both spatially explicit and non-spatial models of deforestation for Colombia. Parameter estimates, analyses of residual spatial autocorrelation, and Bayesian posterior predictive checks were used to compare model performance. Significant residual correlation showed that non-spatial models failed to adequately explain the spatial structure of the data. Posterior predictive checks revealed that spatially explicit models had strong predictive power for the entire range of the response variable and only failed to predict outliers, in contrast with non-spatial models, which lacked predictive power for all response values. The predictive power of non-spatial models was especially low in regions away from Colombia's center, where about half the observations were clustered. While all analyses consistently identified a core of important covariates of deforestation rates, predictive modeling requires parameter estimates informed by the spatial structure of the data. To inform increasingly important forest and carbon sequestration policy, land-use models must account for spatial autocorrelation.","[Mets, Kristjan D.; Davalos, Liliana M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Armenteras, Dolors] Univ Nacl Colombia, Sci Fac, Dept Biol, Landscape Ecol & Ecosyst Modelling Lab, Bogota 111321, Colombia; [Davalos, Liliana M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Consortium Interdisciplinary Environm Res, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,"Mets, KD (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",kristjan.mets@stonybrook.edu,,,,,,,13,14,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2017.0,8,5,,,,,,e01824,10.1002/ecs2.1824,,,,,,,,WOS:000402472300029,

These maps include new data, helping to constrain crustal thickness, whole-crustal average P-wave and S-wave velocity, and the seismic velocity of the uppermost mantle (P-n and S-n). We find that: (1) The weighted average thickness of the crust under South America is 38.17 km (standard deviation, s.d. +/- 8.7 km), which is similar to 1 km thinner than the global average of 39.2 km (s.d. +/- 8.5 km) for continental crust. (2) Histograms of whole-crustal P-wave velocities for the South American crust are bi-modal, with the lower peak occurring for crust that appears to be missing a high-velocity (6.9-7.3 km/s) lower crustal layer. (3) The average P-wave velocity of the crystalline crust (P-cc) is 6.47 km/s (s.d. +/- 0.25 km/s). This is essentially identical to the global average of 6.45 km/s. (4) The average P-n velocity beneath South America is 8.00 km/s (s.d. +/- 0.23 km/s), slightly lower than the global average of 8.07 km/s. (5) A region across northern Chile and northeast Argentina has anomalously low P- and S-wave velocities in the crust. Geographically, this corresponds to the shallowly-subducted portion of the Nazca plate (the Pampean flat slab first described by Isacks et al., 1968), which is also a region of crustal extension. (6) The thick crust of the Brazilian craton appears to extend into Venezuela and Colombia. (7) The crust in the Amazon basin and along the western edge of the Brazilian craton may be thinned by extension. (8) The average crustal P-wave velocity under the eastern Pacific seafloor is higher than under the western Atlantic seafloor, most likely due to the thicker sediment layer on the older Atlantic seafloor.

These gradients could affect necromass stocks, but this has not yet been tested. This study aims to assess the stocks and determinants of necromass across Amazonian forests. Field-based and literature data were used to find relationships between necromass and possible determinants. Furthermore, a simple model was applied to estimate and extrapolate necromass stocks across terra firma Amazonian forests. In eight northwestern and three northeastern Amazonian permanent plots, volumes of coarse woody debris (>= 10 cm diameter) were measured in the field and the density of each decay class was estimated. Forest structure and historical mortality data were used to determine the factors controlling necromass. Necromass is greater in forests with low stem mortality rates (northeast) rather than in forests with high stem mortality rates (northwest) (58.5 +/- 10.6 and 27.3 +/- 3.2 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Using all published necromass values, we find that necromass across terra firma forests in Amazonia is positively related to both forest dynamics (mortality mass inputs and a surrogate for decomposition rate (average wood density of living trees)) and forest structure (biomass), but is better explained by forest dynamics. We propose an improved method to estimate necromass for plots where necromass has not been measured. The estimates, together with other actual measurements of necromass, were scaled-up to project a total Amazonian necromass of 9.6 +/- 1.0 Pg C. The ratio of necromass (on average weighted by forest region) to coarse above-ground biomass is 0.127. Overall, we find (1) a strong spatial trend in necromass in parallel with other macroecological gradients and (2) that necromass is a substantial component of the carbon pool in the Amazon.","[Chao, K. -J.; Phillips, O.

A model of the terrestrial ecosystems (ecosystem demography model 2: ED2) is combined with an atmospheric model (Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System: BRAMS). Two realizations of the structure and composition of terrestrial vegetation are used as the sole differences in boundary conditions that drive two simulations. One realization captures the present day vegetation condition that includes deforestation and land conversion, the other is an estimate of the potential structure and composition of the region's vegetation without human influence. Model output is assessed for differences in resulting hydrometeorology. The simulations suggest that the history of land conversion in northern South America is not associated with a significant precipitation bias in the northern part of the continent, but has shown evidence of a negative bias in mean regional evapotranspiration and a positive bias in mean regional runoff. Also, negative anomalies in evaporation rates showed pattern similarity with areas where deforestation has occurred. In the central eastern Amazon there was an area where deforestation and abandonment had lead to an overall reduction of above-ground biomass, but this was accompanied by a shift in forest composition towards early successional functional types and grid-average-patterned increases in annual transpiration. Anomalies in annual precipitation showed mixed evidence of consistent patterning. Two focus areas were identified where more consistent precipitation anomalies formed, one in the Brazilian state of Para where a dipole pattern formed, and one in the Bolivian Gran Chaco, where a negative anomaly was identified. These locations were scrutinized to understand the basis of their anomalous hydrometeorologic response. In both cases, deforestation led to increased total surface albedo, driving decreases in net radiation, boundary layer moist static energy and ultimately decreased convective precipitation. In the case of the Gran Chaco, decreased precipitation was also a result of decreased advective moisture transport, indicating that differences in local hydrometeorology may manifest via teleconnections with the greater region.","[Knox, R.

The evolutionary history of cebids is far from being well-documented, with notably a complete blank in the record of callitrichine stem lineages until and after the late middle Miocene (Laventan SALMA). Further documenting their evolutionary history is therefore of primary importance. MaterialRecent field efforts in Peruvian Amazonia (Contamana area, Loreto Department) have allowed for the discovery of an early late Miocene (ca. 11 Ma; Mayoan SALMA) fossil primate-bearing locality (CTA-43; Pebas Formation). In this study, we analyze the primate material, which consists of five isolated teeth documenting two distinct Cebidae: Cebus sp., a medium-sized capuchin (Cebinae), and Cebuella sp., a tiny marmoset (Callitrichinae). ResultsAlthough limited, this new fossil material of platyrrhines contributes to documenting the post-Laventan evolutionary history of cebids, and besides testifies to the earliest occurrences of the modern Cebuella and Cebus/Sapajus lineages in the Neotropics. Regarding the evolutionary history of callitrichine marmosets, the discovery of an 11 Ma-old fossil representative of the modern Cebuella pushes back by at least 6 Ma the age of the Mico/Cebuella divergence currently proposed by molecular biologists (i.e., ca. 4.5 Ma). This also extends back to>11 Ma BP the divergence between Callithrix and the common ancestor (CA) of Mico/Cebuella, as well as the divergence between the CA of marmosets and Callimico (Goeldi's callitrichine). DiscussionThis discovery from Peruvian Amazonia implies a deep evolutionary root of the Cebuella lineage in the northwestern part of South America (the modern western Amazon basin), slightly before the recession of the Pebas mega-wetland system (PMWS), ca. 10.5 Ma, and well-before the subsequent establishment of the Amazon drainage system (ca. 9-7 Ma). During the late middle/early late Miocene interval, the PMWS was seemingly not a limiting factor for dispersals and widespread distribution of terrestrial mammals, but it was also likely a source of diversification via a complex patchwork of submerged/emerged lands varying through time.","[Marivaux, Laurent; Adnet, Sylvain; Ramdarshan, Anusha; Antoine, Pierre-Olivier] Univ Montpellier, ISE M, Lab Paleontol, UMR 5554,CNRS UM IRD EPHE, Cc 064, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Altamirano-Sierra, Ali J.; Salas-Gismondi, Rodolfo; Tejada-Lara, Julia V.] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos MUSM, Museo Hist Nat, Dept Paleontol Vertebrados, Lima 11, Peru; [Pujos, Francois] CCT CONICET Mendoza, Inst Argentino Nivol Glaciol & Ciencias Ambiental, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Tejada-Lara, Julia V.] Columbia Univ City New York, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Tejada-Lara, Julia V.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Vertebrate Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA",,"Marivaux, L; Antoine, PO (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, ISE M, Lab Paleontol, UMR 5554,CNRS UM IRD EPHE, Cc 064, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France.",laurent.marivaux@umontpellier.fr; pierre-olivier.antoine@umontpellier.fr,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2016.0,161,3,,,,478,493,,10.1002/ajpa.23052,,,,,,,,WOS:000387786500009,

These satellites' sampling characteristics provide nearly constant observation geometry and low illumination variation through the scene. However, the illumination variation throughout the year impacts the surface reflectance by producing higher values for low solar zenith angles and lower reflectance for large zenith angles. In this work, we present a model to derive the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization and apply it to the HLS product at 30 m spatial resolution. It is based on the BRDF parameters estimated from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product (M{O,Y}D09) at 1 km spatial resolution using the VJB method (Vermote et al., 2009). Unsupervised classification (segmentation) of HLS images is used to disaggregate the BRDF parameters to the HLS spatial resolution and to build a BRDF parameters database at HLS scale. We first test the proposed BRDF normalization for different solar zenith angles over two homogeneous sites, in particular one desert and one Peruvian Amazon forest. The proposed method reduces both the correlation with the solar zenith angle and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the reflectance time series in the red and near infrared bands to 4% in forest and keeps a low CV of 3% to 4% for the deserts. Additionally, we assess the impact of the view zenith angle (VZA) in an area of the Brazilian Amazon forest close to the equator, where impact of the angular variation is stronger because it occurs in the principal plane. The directional reflectance shows a strong dependency with the VZA. The current HLS BRDF correction reduces this dependency but still shows an under-correction, especially in the near infrared, while the proposed method shows no dependency with the view angles. We also evaluate the BRDF parameters using field surface albedo measurements as a reference over seven different sites of the US surface radiation budget observing network (SURFRAD) and five sites of the Australian OzFlux network.","[Franch, Belen; Skakun, Sergii; Roger, Jean-Claude; Villaescusa-Nadal, Jose Luis; Santamaria-Artigas, Andres] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Franch, Belen; Vermote, Eric; Skakun, Sergii; Roger, Jean-Claude; Masek, Jeffrey; Ju, Junchang; Villaescusa-Nadal, Jose Luis; Santamaria-Artigas, Andres] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Ju, Junchang] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",,"Franch, B (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.; Franch, B (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",befranch@umd.edu; eric.f.vermote@nasa.gov; skakun@umd.edu; roger63@umd.edu; jeffrey.g.masek@nasa.gov; junchang.ju@nasa.gov; jvillaes@terpmail.umd.edu; asantam@umd.edu,,,,,,,23,24,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2,2019.0,11,6,,,,,,632,10.3390/rs11060632,,,,,,,,WOS:000465615300031,

Particular attention is drawn to the strong relationship between forest productivity and turnover, which suggests that higher levels of forest productivity increase forest dynamism rather than forest biomass.

The last official report of a clinical case of HDV infection in Colombia was registered in 2005. Objectives: The aims of this study were to identify cases of HDV and/or Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in asymptomatic Amerindians from Amazonas state, South East Colombia, and to describe the circulating viral genotypes in this population. Study design: The study population was recruited in 19 Amerindian communities in the Amazonas state. Individuals over 18 years old were screened by rapid test for Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg). Blood samples obtained from individuals positives for HBsAg in the rapid-test assay were analyzed for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HDV IgM/IgG by ELISA. The detection of HBV DNA and HDV RNA was performed by PCR amplification. The viral genotype was determined by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results: A total of 23/861 individuals were positive for HBsAg detection by rapid test. Serological and/or molecular markers of HDV infection were demonstrated in 43.5 % (10/23) of samples from Amerindians. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the exclusive circulation of HBV subgenotype F1b of and HDV 3 in this population. Conclusions: A high frequency of HBV/HDV infection was found in Amerindian population from Amazonas State, Colombia (43.5 %, 10/23). Nine cases were identified in a population of 861 asymptomatic Amerindian individuals; one symptomatic case (with diagnosis of end-stage hepatic disease) was also identified in the study. The circulation of HDV 3 and HBV subgenotype F1b suggests a constant flow of these viral genotypes as a result of the interaction of the Amerindian populations from Amazon basin.

While all pitheciids eat hard or tough seeds, Chiropotes and Pithecia have been documented to consume more than Callicebus. In this study, we explored whether measures of molar microwear texture complexity discriminate taxa following variation in reliance upon seeds, and whether dispersion among variables is greatest in Callicebus, which has the most variable diet. Here we report results for a study of microwear textures on M-2 Phase II facets of Ch. satanas (N = 14), P. irrorata (N = 8), and Ca. moloch (N = 24) from the Brazilian Amazon (Oriximina, UHESamuel, and Taperinha, respectively). Textures examined using a scanning confocal profiler showed significant differences in central tendencies for three measures: mean dale area (Sda), anisotropy (Str), and heterogeneity (HAsfc(9)). Ten measures showed significant differences in dispersion, with Callicebus being significantly more variable in eight of those ten. These results demonstrate that the pitheciids with different morphological adaptations and dietary reliance on seeds differ in their dental microwear textures, though less than initially hypothesized. Measures of dispersion, especially, show potential for identifying dietary variability.","[Ragni, Anna J.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Ragni, Anna J.] New York Consortium Evolutionary Primatol, New York, NY USA; [Teaford, Mark F.] Touro Univ Calif, Dept Basic Sci, Vallejo, CA USA; [Ungar, Peter S.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Anthropol, Old Main 330C, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",,"Ungar, PS (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Anthropol, Old Main 330C, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",pungar@uark.edu,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2017.0,79,12,,,,,,e22697,10.1002/ajp.22697,,,,,,,,WOS:000417173400010,

However, habitat sustainability relies on ecological interactions among species, such as seed dispersal. Thus, a community-scale conservation strategy may be more valuable in some settings. We describe communities of primary (primates) and secondary (dung beetles) seed dispersers from 5 sites in the Brazilian Amazon. We estimate community biomass of these taxa and, using multivariate ordination, examine the potential for natural reforestation at each site, given the communities of seed dispersers present. Since disturbed habitat is increasingly common and increasingly the focus of conservation efforts, we also examine differences among seed disperser communities between primary forest and secondary growth at each site. Analyses of faunal biomass in different localities and habitats indicate that secondary growth receives nearly as much use by primates as primary forest; given the dominant groups of dung beetles in secondary growth, disturbed habitat should show a pattern of seed burial that is clumped and deep. Areas with high biomass of Alouatta spp. and the large nocturnal dung beetle species may have the greatest potential for natural reforestation of secondary growth particularly for large seeded species. The data suggest that knowledge of the biomass of primary and secondary dispersing fauna facilitates predictions for the likelihood of disturbed habitat to regenerate and comparisons of sites in broader geographical areas e.g., Neotropical vs. Paleotropical forests.","Delaware State Univ, Dept Agr & Nat Resources, Dover, DE 19901 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anthropol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Vulinec, K (corresponding author), Delaware State Univ, Dept Agr & Nat Resources, Dover, DE 19901 USA.",kvulinec@desu.edu,,,,,,,34,38,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2006.0,27,3,,,,855,879,,10.1007/s10764-006-9027-2,,,,,,,,WOS:000239645800011,

However, few studies have paired intact mangroves with degraded sites to determine carbon losses due to land conversion. To address this gap we quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks in mangroves and cattle pastures formed from mangroves in the large wetland complex of the Pantanos de Centla in SE Mexico. The mean total ecosystem carbon stocks of fringe and estuarine tall mangroves was 1358 Mg C/ha. In contrast the mean carbon stocks of cattle pastures was 458 Mg C/ha. Based upon a biomass equivalence of losses from the top 1 m of mangrove soils, the losses in carbon stocks from mangrove conversion are conservatively estimated at 1464 Mg CO(2)e/ha. These losses were 7-fold that of emissions from tropical dry forest to pasture conversion and 3-fold greater than emissions from Amazon forest to pasture conversion. However, we found that limiting ecosystem carbon stocks differences to the surface 1 m or even 2 m soil depth will miss losses that occurred from deeper horizons. Mangrove conversion to other land uses comes at a great cost in terms of greenhouse gas emissions as well losses of other important ecosystem services.","[Kauffman, J.

The degree of connectivity between these distantly separated populations is of interest because it provides insight into processes at both evolutionary and ecological time scales, such as speciation, recruitment dynamics and the persistence of coral populations. To assess connectivity in broadly distributed coral species of the Atlantic, DNA sequence data from two nuclear markers were obtained for six coral species spanning their distributional ranges. At basin-wide scales, significant differentiation was generally observed among populations in the Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa. Concordance of patterns in connectivity among co-distributed taxa indicates that extrinsic barriers, such as the Amazon freshwater plume or long stretches of open ocean, restrict dispersal of coral larvae from region to region. Within regions, dispersal ability appears to be influenced by aspects of reproduction and life history. Two broadcasting species, Siderastrea siderea and Montastraea cavernosa, were able to maintain gene flow among populations separated by as much as 1,200 km along the coast of Brazil. In contrast, brooding species, such as Favia gravida and Siderastrea radians, had more restricted gene flow along the Brazilian coast.","[Nunes, Flavia L.

Several linalool-producing species are used in traditional medical systems. Among these is Aeolanthus suaveolens G. Dom (Labiatae) which is used as an anticonvulsant in the Brazilian Amazon. Psychopharmacological in vivo evaluation of linalool showed that this compound has dose-dependent marked sedative effects at the central nervous system (CNS), including hypnotic, anticonvulsant and hypothermic properties. It has been suggested that these neurochemical effects might be ascribed to the local anaesthetic activity of linalool. The present study reports an inhibitory effect of linalool on the acetylcholine (ACh) release and on the channel open time in the mouse neuromuscular junction. These findings could provide a rational basis to confirm the traditional medical use of linalool-producing plant species. Indeed,our data demonstrate some interactions in the modulation of the ACh release at the mouse neuromuscular junction, which are well correlated with the suggested molecular mechanisms. Linalool induced a reduction of the ACh-evoked release. The possibility that this effect could be ascribed to some interaction with pre-synaptic function is noteworthy. Moreover, the inhibitory effect induced on the kinetics of the miniature end-plate current decay demonstrates a local anaesthetic action, either on the voltage or on the receptor-activated channels.

The long-standing view that Amazonia was only minimally impacted by human actions has been challenged, and a new paradigm of Amazonia as a manufactured landscape is emerging. If such disturbance was the norm until just 500 years ago, Amazonian ecosystems could be far more ecologically resilient to disturbance than previously supposed. Alternatively, if the manufactured landscape label is an overstatement, then policy that assumes such resilience may cause substantial and long-lasting ecological damage. We present paleoecological data suggesting a middle path, in which some areas were heavily modified, but most of Amazonia was minimally impacted. Bluffs adjacent to main river channels and highly seasonal areas appear to have been the most extensively settled locations. Away from areas where humans lived, their influence on ecosystems was very local. Consequently, we see no evidence suggesting that large areas at a distance from rivers or in the less seasonal parts of Amazonia were substantially altered by human activity. Extrapolating from sites of known human occupation to infer Amazon-wide landscape disturbance may therefore potentially lead to unrealistic projections of human impact and misguided policy.","Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27104 USA",,"Bush, MB (corresponding author), Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA.",mbush@fit.edu,,,,,,,74,76,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2007.0,5,9,,,,457,465,,10.1890/070018,,,,,,,,WOS:000250659900003,

In the case of the study presented here, the concepts of vulnerability, fragility and criticality are used. In studies of rural areas, the so-called land manager represents the main focus of interest. This is due to the fact that the land manager forms the nexus between ecology and socio-economy at the local level. In this context, pioneer frontiers serve as refuge areas for displaced groups. However, with their incorporation into the national economic and social structures this function is rapidly lost again. In this paper, the decisive factors and processes of the development of the frontier are investigated by taking a case-study from the Brazilian Mid-West as an example. Ecological processes of degradation in the areas of the pioneer frontiers of the Amazon region can be understood as the result of global, national and regional-local structures due to which particularly vulnerable groups - in this case peasants - are displaced into ecologically fragile areas in the course of time. The survival-oriented exploitation of the natural resources in this refuge area corresponds with the peasants' logic of action. This logic, which must be seen as a survival strategy, is based on decisions governed by vulnerability and constraints in the actual everyday situation.","Univ Tubingen, Inst Geog, Forsch Schwerpunkt Latein Amer, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",,"Neuburger, M (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Geog, Forsch Schwerpunkt Latein Amer, Holderlinstr 12, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",,,,,,,,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,,2000.0,88,1,,,,21,35,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000165823000002,

Consequently, landuse practices, which can affect many of these components, play a crucial role in determining the rate and magnitude of smoke production from biomass burning. The variability of landuse and its relation to the magnitude and rate of smoke production, however, usually are not considered when estimating biomass emissions. For example, much prescribed wildland burning in the United States has changed from high-intensity slash burning associated with land clearing activities, in which 20 hectare fires typically emit more than 10,000 grams/second of particles within an hour or two, to low-intensity understory burning related to health management where 120 hectare fires emit less than 2,000 grams/second of particles for several hours to days. Total emissions may be similar hut the duration of emissions and associated heat release rates are significantly different, causing vastly different impacts on visibility, human health, and climatic forcing. Despite changes in landuse and fire, many regional and global estimates of biomass emissions in the United States continue to assume that most emissions result from land-clearing type slash burns. Meanwhile, in South America estimates of biomass emissions typically assume dry fuels, yet most burning occurs within a few months of harvesting. The large logs remain wet, reducing emissions by more than 50%, which is unaccounted for in global emission estimates. Also, while land-clearing remains vigorous in the tropics, a change toward using fire for health management already has begun. In this paper, an emission production model is used to show the differences in emission magnitudes and rates for prescribed fires in rain forests of Washington State and the Brazilian Amazon, and in dry forests of Oregon State and the Brazilian cerrado. In addition to emissions of particles and carbon gases, the model estimates heat release rates that affect plume buoyancy. These values are used to evaluate impacts on human health, visibility, and components of climate forcing.","Forestry Sci Lab, Seattle, WA USA",,"Ferguson, SA (corresponding author), Forestry Sci Lab, 4043 Roosevelt Way NE, Seattle, WA USA.",,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,,2000.0,3,,,,,33,50,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000085482600003,

A simple numerical model of two-dimensional heat flow is developed and applied to a vertical forest/clearcut edge profile and to simulated fragmented landscapes. Height-specific thermal diffusivity and conductivity in the forest were assumed to vary in proportion to foliage densities measured in the central Amazon. In the edge profile, the clearcut that abutted the edge served as a heat source and its temperature was maintained at a constant value higher than in the initially cooler forest. In the fragmented landscapes, simulated treefall gaps were heat sources whose temperature varied with sun movements during the day. Gap frequency was varied so as to approximate the gap coverage observed in selectively logged forests. In one set of simulations, temperature in the openings was systematically varied; in another, thermal diffusivity of the forest was varied. Along the edge profile, high temperatures in the clearcut were rapidly transmitted into the upper canopy due to additive edge effects. Temperatures in the forest understory were also very sensitive to clearcut temperatures due to relatively sparse understory foliage. An overall increase in forest diffusivity led to markedly higher temperatures close to the edge and a more even temperature distribution among height strata. In fragmented landscapes, total gap coverage and additivity from neighboring gaps strongly influenced forest temperatures. At low conductivities, heat flowed only into the forest close to the gaps and hence forest temperature increased almost linearly with gap area. However, at high conductivities, heat flowed far into the forest and forest temperature varied as a function of gap density in the surrounding neighborhood. Because of these additive effects, slight increases in total gap area led to disproportionate changes in the thermal profile of the landscape. These results have important implications for the conservation of forest ecosystems.","Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada",,"Malcolm, JR (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada.",,,,,,,,45,46,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,1998.0,39,2-3,,,,487,502,,10.1023/A:1005376603186,,,,,,,,WOS:000075280900018,

Location Eastern Brazilian Amazonia, Amapa State. Methods The fossil pollen and charcoal records of two lakes in Amapa (Marcio and Tapera) were used to provide a Holocene palaeoecological history of eastern Amazonian savannas. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to enhance the patterns of sample distribution along the sediment core. Results Even though sedimentary hiatuses were recognized in the sediment cores from both lakes, a marked change in vegetation from closed forests with swamp elements to open flooded savanna at c. 5000 yr BP was evident from the pollen record. Charcoal analysis revealed a pattern of increased accumulation of charred particles coincident with the establishment of savanna vegetation, suggesting higher fire frequency near the lakes. Because the timing of the sedimentary hiatus overlapped with the highest Holocene sea level, which would have increased the local water table preventing the lakes from drying out, we infer that both lakes used to depend heavily on flood waters, and the sedimentary gap was caused by reduced discharge from the Amazon River, due to a dry period in the Andes, when precipitation levels markedly decreased between 8000 and 5000 yr BP. The lack of Andean pollen (probably river transported) in the sediment record after this event and the existence of similar records near the study site make this interpretation more appealing. The resumption of sedimentation in Lake Marcio, contemporaneous with falling sea level and increasingly wet conditions in the Andes after 5000 yr BP, indicates that Holocene sea-level variation did not play an important role in maintaining lake levels. Main conclusions The study site recorded-long-term occupation by pre-Columbian peoples. However, it is still unclear whether these disjoint savannas have an anthropogenic origin. Even though locally dry environmental conditions were inferred from both records, there is no evidence of a mid-Holocene dry climate in eastern Amazonia. Instead, the Amapa record indicates a connection between Andean climate and eastern Amazonia, demonstrating the need for a better understanding of the impacts and magnitude of climate changes.","Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",,"De Toledo, MB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Geol, Av Gal Milton Tavares Souza,S-N 4 Andar, BR-24210340 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",mtoledo@igeo.uff.br,,,,,,,32,32,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2007.0,34,8,,,,1313,1326,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01606.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000248851000005,

This global scheme can be intensified to produce results at the national level. In this paper, using surrogate observations, we compare the deforestation estimates derived from these two levels of sampling intensities (one, the global, for the Brazilian Amazon the other, national, for French Guiana) to estimates derived from the official inventories. We also report the precisions that are achieved due to sampling errors and, in the case of French Guiana, compare such precision with the official inventory precision. We extract nine sample data sets from the official wall-to-wall deforestation map derived from satellite interpretations produced for the Brazilian Amazon for the year 2002 to 2003. This global sampling scheme estimate gives 2.81 million ha of deforestation (mean from nine simulated replicates) with a standard error of 0.10 million ha. This compares with the full population estimate from the wall-to-wall interpretations of 2.73 million ha deforested, which is within one standard error of our sampling test estimate. The relative difference between the mean estimate from sampling approach and the full population estimate is 3.1%, and the standard error represents 4.0% of the full population estimate. This global sampling is then intensified to a territorial level with a case study over French Guiana to estimate deforestation between the years 1990 and 2006. For the historical reference period, 1990, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data were used. A coverage of SPOT-HRV imagery at 20 m x 20 m resolution acquired at the Cayenne receiving station in French Guiana was used for year 2006. Our estimates from the intensified global sampling scheme over French Guiana are compared with those produced by the national authority to report on deforestation rates under the Kyoto protocol rules for its overseas department. The latter estimates come from a sample of nearly 17,000 plots analyzed from same spatial imagery acquired between year 1990 and year 2006. This sampling scheme is derived from the traditional forest inventory methods carried out by IFN (Inventaire Forestier National). Our intensified global sampling scheme leads to an estimate of 96,650 ha deforested between 1990 and 2006, which is within the 95% confidence interval of the IFN sampling scheme, which gives an estimate of 91,722 ha, representing a relative difference from the IFN of 5.4%. These results demonstrate that the intensification of the global sampling scheme can provide forest area change estimates close to those achieved by official forest inventories (<6%), with precisions of between 4% and 7%, although we only estimate errors from sampling, not from the use of surrogate data. Such methods could be used by developing countries to demonstrate that they are fulfilling requirements for reducing emissions from deforestation in the framework of an REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries) mechanism under discussion within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Monitoring systems at national levels in tropical countries can also benefit from pan-tropical and regional observations, to ensure consistency between different national monitoring systems.

This question is addressed using evolutionary rate analysis of sequence data of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers in diverse taxa occupying neotropical seasonally dry forests, including Ruprechtia (Polygonaceae), robinioid legumes (Fabaceae), Chaetocalyx and Nissolia (Fabaceae), and Loxopterygium (Anacardiaceae). Species diversifications in these taxa occurred both during and before the Pleistocene in Central America, but were primarily pre-Pleistocene in South America. This indicates plausibility both for models that predict tropical species diversity to be recent and that invoke a role for Pleistocene climatic change, and those that consider it ancient and implicate geological factors such as the Andean orogeny and the closure of the Panama Isthmus. Cladistic vicariance analysis was attempted to identify common factors underlying evolution in these groups.

Apart from their geographical occurrence, Cerrado streams are characterized by extremely low conductivity, weak buffering capacity and variable pH values which are a consequence of the ion poverty of the soils. The hydrographs show very stable patterns during the dry season and frequently recurring flashfloods during the rainy season. The biota of Cerrado streams reveal a range of characteristics such as a reduced proportion of shredding invertebrates, large numbers of predators, and high resistance and resilience to spates. Species traits of aquatic insects include adaptations such as small body size, polivoltine life cycles and the synchronous occurrence of different larval stages.

The process is one of the most controversial topics of the speciation debate, particularly in tropical regions. Here, we investigate ecologically based divergence across an Amazonian ecotone in the electric fish, Steatogenys elegans. We combine phylogenetics, genome scans, and population genetics with a recently developed individual-based evolutionary landscape genetics approach that incorporates selection. This framework is used to assess the relative contributions of geography and divergent natural selection between environments as biodiversity drivers. We report on two closely related and sympatric lineages that exemplify how divergent selection across a major Amazonian aquatic ecotone (i.e., between rivers with markedly different hydrochemical properties) may result in replicated ecologically mediated speciation. The results link selection across an ecological gradient with reproductive isolation and we propose that assortative mating based on water color may be driving the divergence. Divergence resulting from ecologically driven selection highlights the importance of considering environmental heterogeneity in studies of speciation in tropical regions. Furthermore, we show that framing ecological speciation in a spatially explicit evolutionary landscape genetics framework provides an important first step in exploring a wide range of the potential effects of spatial dependence in natural selection.","[Cooke, Georgina M.; Beheregaray, Luciano B.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mol Ecol Lab, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Cooke, Georgina M.] Australian Museum, Australian Museum Res Inst, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Landguth, Erin L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Beheregaray, Luciano B.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Mol Ecol Lab, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",,"Cooke, GM (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mol Ecol Lab, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",luciano.beheregaray@flinders.edu.au,,,,,,,24,24,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2014.0,68,7,,,,1947,1960,,10.1111/evo.12410,,,,,,,,WOS:000339052000009,

Increased fish consumption levels were the strongest indicators of increased total mercury levels across the entire population. The levels of total mercury in hair was significantly (alpha = 0.05) higher in mining zones, than Puerto Maldonado.

In this study, we combine Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) project data collected from a network of eddy covariance flux towers deployed across the Amazonian basin to improve the carbon stocks and flux estimated by a land surface model, the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM). We evaluate the key model parameters for carbon allocation factors, maintenance respiration as well as the autotrophic respiration using the LBA site measurements. Our model results show that the total biomass ranges from 0.7 kg Cm-2 yr(-1) for the pasture site to 20.8 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) for the forest site. The ISAM estimates for GPP and NPP are well within the uncertainty range of the site measurement data. Also, the results revealed that all, but one forest site have lower net primary productivity (NPP) to gross primary productivity (GPP) ratio (NPP/GPP = 0.4 compared to the savanna and the pasture sites (NPP/GPP = 0.5). This is because savanna and the pasture sites experienced the longest dry season and plants growing in such environmental conditions have stronger efficiency to store carbon compared to forests. The forest evergreen site (Km67) has a higher measured NPP/GPP ratio (0.5), because of higher carbon accumulation. Soil carbon is lowest for the pasture site (Km77) (7.2 kg Cm-2 yr(-1)) and highest for the forest site (Km34) (12.8 kg Cm-2 yr(-1)). The model results suggest that all the forest sites are a net sink for atmospheric CO2, while the savanna (PDG) and pasture (FNS) sites are neutral and another pasture site (Km77) is net source for atmospheric CO2. Meanwhile, the model results highlight the importance of the LBA site data to improve the model performance for the tropical Amazon region. The study also suggest the need for a network of long-term monitoring plans to measure changes in the vegetation and soil carbon biomass at the local and regional levels.

Additionally, 45 DNA samples from wild pumas from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela and western Brazilian Amazon were analyzed by means of hair with roots, little pieces of skins, Muscle tissues and teeth. All these 53 Puma DNA were genotypified for seven microsatellites (Fca 08, 24, 43, 45, 96, 126 and 39 1). The levels of gene diversity were very high in both sample groups (H 0.942 and 0.845, respectively), with values considerably higher than those found in the North American pumas. Diverse population assignment analyses showed that the Bolivian Andean pumas did not form a different significant cluster from the other puma group studied. Only Fca 96 showed significant heterogeneity between both groups. Nevertheless, globally, this heterogeneity was very small (F-ST, G(ST), R-ST). On the contrary, the gene flow estimates between both groups were very elevated for all the procedures performed. The estimation of the parameter theta (= 4N(e)mu), by means of the maximum likelihood procedure of Nielsen (1997), showed that the Bolivian sample is a similar extension of the puma population of the other Latin American Countries analyzed. Therefore, this study yielded strong results in favor of an unique gene pool of pumas in north western South America, in contrast with the traditional morphology and morphometric classifications which had identified a considerable number of puma subspecies in this region of Latin America.","[Ruiz-Garcia, Manuel; Alvarez, Diana] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Unidad Genet Genet Poblac Mol Biol Evolut, Bogota 4382, Colombia",,"Ruiz-Garcia, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Unidad Genet Genet Poblac Mol Biol Evolut, Carretera 7A, Bogota 4382, Colombia.",mruiz@javeriana.edu.co,,,,,,,8,10,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2009.0,82,1,,,,97,117,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000266395400007,

General concepts and practical issues are illustrated by the validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire product in Siberia. Coincident Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) imagery is used to characterize spatial patterns of flaming at sub-MODIS pixel scale. It is shown that for proper evaluation reference fire observations are needed at the scale of the satellite pixel, as only 60% of the MODIS footprints contain single contiguous clusters of ASTER fire pixels. In Siberia the size of a single ASTER fire cluster within the MODIS footprint that has a 50% probability of being flagged as fire is similar to 60, compared to similar to 45 in the Brazilian Amazon, whereas previous radiative transfer simulations suggested similar detection probabilities. The lower-than-expected detection rates in Siberia are largely attributable to flaming underneath heavy smoke, which is not detected by the current MODIS algorithm. Pixel-based and cluster-based omission error rates are derived, and it is shown that the probability of flagging as fire a MODIS pixel which contains a given number of 30-m ASTER fire pixels is typically 3-5 times lower than detecting a contiguous cluster with the same number of ASTER fire pixels. The procedures described are recommended for a consensus active fire validation protocol, but with the inclusion of multiplatform sensor configurations to complement the near-nadir angular sampling from single-platform observations such as MODIS and ASTER on Terra.","Univ Maryland, Dept Geog, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Sci Syst & Applicat Incorp, Lanham, MD 20706 USA",,"Csiszar, IA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",icsiszar@hermes.geog.umd.edu,,,,,,,105,112,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2006.0,44,7,1,,,1757,1764,,10.1109/TGRS.2006.875941,,,,,,,,WOS:000238864700008,

Two experimental studies have shown accelerated closure of nonsplinted excisional wounds in rat models. However, these models allow for significant contraction of the wound and do not approximate healing in the tight skin of humans. Methods: Full-thickness excisional wounds were created on the dorsal skin of mice and were splinted with silicone rings, a model that forces the wound to heal by granulation and reepithelialization. Sanativo or a control solution was applied either daily or every other day to the wounds. Photographs were taken every other day, and the degree of reepithelialization of the wounds was determined. Results: With both daily and every-other-day applications, Sanativo delayed reepithelialization of the wounds. Average time to complete healing was faster with control solution versus Sanativo in the daily application group ( 9.4 versus 15.2 days; p < 0.0001) and the every-other-day application group ( 11 versus 13 days; p = 0.017). The size of visible scar at the last time point of the study was not significantly different between the groups, and no differences were found on histologic examination. Conclusions: Sanativo wound healing compound delayed wound reepithelialization in a mouse splinted excisional wound model that approximates human wound healing. The size of visible scar after complete healing was not improved with the application of Sanativo. These results should cast doubt on claims that this product can improve wound healing in humans.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Longaker, MT (corresponding author), Hagey Lab Pediat Regenerat Med, 257 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",longaker@stanford.edu,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2017.0,139,2,,,,343,352,,10.1097/PRS.0000000000003013,,,,,,,,WOS:000394059300010,

Herbal medicines may provide an alternative or complementary approach. Taheebo, extracted from the inner bark of the Tabebuia avellandae tree found in the Brazilian Amazon, exhibits selective anti-proliferative effects in carcinoma cell lines. The present study identifies the mechanistic leads for the inhibitory effects of Taheebo. Human breast carcinoma derived ER+ MCF-7 cells were used as the model. Aqueous extract of Taheebo was the test compound. Cell cycle analysis, clonogenic assay, and global gene expression profiles were the quantitative parameters. Taheebo treatment resulted in a dose/time-dependent growth inhibition (S phase arrest, reduced clonogenecity) and initiation of apoptosis (chromatin condensation). A 6-h treatment with 1.5 mg/ml Taheebo modulated the gene expression of G2 specific cyclin B1 (-2.0-fold) S phase specific PCNA (-2.0-fold) and OKL38 (+11.0-fold); apoptosis specific GADD-45 family (+1.9-5.4-fold), Caspases (+1.6-1.7-fold), BCL-2 family (-1.5-2.5-fold), estrogen responsive ESR1 (-1.5-fold), and xeno-biotic metabolism specific CYP 1A1 (+19.8 fold) and CYP 1B1 (+7.9-fold). The anti-proliferative effects of Taheebo correlate with down-regulated cell cycle regulatory and estrogen responsive genes, and up-regulated apoptosis specific and xeno-biotic metabolism specific genes.

Residues 90-94 of SU are considered as a Nrp1 binding site, and our previous results show that an SU peptide consisting of residues 85-94 can bind directly to the Nrp1 b1 domain with a binding affinity of 7.4 mu M. Therefore, the SU peptide is expected to be a good model to investigate the SU-Nrp1 interaction. Recently, the N93D mutation in the Nrp1 b1 binding region of the SU was identified in symptomatic patients with HTLV-1 infections in the Brazilian Amazon. However, it remains unclear how the SUN93D mutation affects Nrp1 b1 binding. To elucidate the impact of the substituted Asp93 of SU on Nrp1 b1 binding, we analyzed the interaction between the SU-N93D peptide and Nrp1 b1 using isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance. The SU-N93D peptide binds directly to Nrp1 b1 with a binding affinity of 3.5 mu M, which is approximately two-fold stronger than wild-type. This stronger binding is likely a result of the interaction between the substituted residue Asp93 of the N93D peptide and the four residues Trp301, Lys347, Glu348, and Thr349 of Nrp1 b1. Our results suggest that the interaction of SU Asp93 with the four residues of Nrp1 b1 renders the high affinity of the N93D mutant for Nrp1 b1 binding during HTLV-1 entry.","[Kusunoki, Hideki; Ohshima, Chinatsu; Hamaguchi, Isao] Natl Inst Infect Dis, Dept Safety Res Blood & Biol Prod, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo 2080011, Japan; [Tanaka, Toshiyuki] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; [Tanaka, Toshiyuki] Univ Tsukuba, Life Sci Ctr, Tsukuba Adv Res Alliance, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Sakamoto, Taiichi] Chiba Inst Technol, Fac Adv Engn, Dept Life Sci, 2-17-1 Tsudanuma, Narashino, Chiba 2750016, Japan; [Wakamatsu, Kaori] Gunma Univ, Dept Mol Sci, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 1-5-1 Tenjin Cho, Kiryu, Gumma 3768515, Japan",,"Kusunoki, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Infect Dis, Dept Safety Res Blood & Biol Prod, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo 2080011, Japan.",kusunoki@niid.go.jp,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021.0,1869,11,,,,,,140708,10.1016/j.bbapap.2021.140708,,AUG 2021,,,,,,WOS:000687567500004,

The antioxidant and anti-radical properties of E. oleracea juice are well known; the chemical characterisation of its phenolic composition as well as its potential use as food ingredient and natural pigment have been previously studied. Cyanidin 3-O-glycoside, and various hydroxy-benzoic and hydroxy-cinnamic acids were detected in E. oleracea juice. The radical scavenging properties, measured as the mean of DPPH radical tests, were similar to those obtained by a common commercial bilberry juice. Therefore, novel natural colorants from E. oleracea juice could be considered as functional ingredients for their anti-oxidant and anti-radical activity. Yogurt is a typical fermented dairy product consumed all around the world; the yogurt flavouring is obtained both by means of natural ingredients like fruit juices and also by synthetic aromas. The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of E. oleracea fruit juice as a natural colorant for yogurt. The results obtained showed that yogurt enriched with Euterpe juice (10%, w/w) showed characteristics similar to those of typical commercial yogurt with bilberry juice. Aggregation of milk proteins in the E. oleracea containing yogurt was measured by SDS-PAGE. The protein profile of the E. oleracea containing yogurt was essentially identical to the untreated control yogurt. In conclusion, we suggest that E. oleracea juice could be used as a natural functional pigment for flavouring and colouring yogurt. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Within Gymnotus, the subgenus Lamontianus is a phenotypically distinctive Glade with an elongate, cylindrical body shape currently known from four valid species (G. anguillaris, G. cataniapo, G. pedunopterus, and G. tiquie) restricted to rivers draining the Guiana Shield. Here we use aspects of body-surface coloration, meristic, morphological, and osteological data, including cranial, laterosensory pore, and postcranial characters, to diagnose two new species of Lamontianus that inhabit the Aripuana and Arapiuns rivers that drain the Brazilian Shield. We also use geometric morphometric analyses of head shape to separate the new species from one another and other species of Lamontianus. We report biogeographic distributions for all species of Lamontianus and estimate ancestral geographic ranges and range evolution using the parametric biogeographic program BioGeoBEARS. We use the phylogeny of Lamontianus to test alternative hypotheses regarding lineage divergence times, before or after the formation of the modern East-draining Amazon at c. 10 Ma. Our analysis suggests that diversification in Lamontianus occurred primarily by geographic range fragmentation (vicariance) from an ancestral species distributed across the Western Guiana Shield. These results are similar to those of other Gymnotus and gymnotiform Glades, where allopatric speciation and secondary contact due to geographic range expansion are commonly observed. This study brings to 46 the number of valid species of the genus Gymnotus, and to six the number of valid species of the subgenus tamontinnus.","[Kim, Lesley Y.; Albert, James S.] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, POB 43602, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA; [Crampton, William G.

From the Brazilian Amazon to mineral-rich Sub-Saharan Africa, the practice of unequal ecological exchange persists. Simultaneously, a global environmental regime has coalesced as a prominent feature of the contemporary world system. In the post-World War II era, legitimate nation-states must take steps to protect the natural environment and prevent its degradation even at their own economic expense. Stronger national ties to global institutions, particularly international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) consistently yield more positive environmental outcomes. However, previous work suggests that normative expectations for improved environmental practices will be weak or nonexistent in the periphery. We use the case of palm oil production and its relationship to deforestation to provide a more nuanced analysis of the relationship between material and institutional forces in the periphery. Using unbalanced panels of fifteen palm oil producing countries from 1990 to 2012, we find that stronger national ties to world society via citizen memberships in INGOs result in greater primary forest area among palm oil producers. However, this effect is strongest where production is lowest and weakens as production increases. Even in the cases of Indonesia and Malaysia, where palm oil production is substantially higher than any other producer, ties to global institutions are significantly related to reduced forest loss. These results indicate the variable importance of national embeddedness into global institutions within the periphery of the world system.","[Henderson, Kent] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Sociol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Shorette, Kristen] SUNY Stony Brook, Sociol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,"Henderson, K (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Sociol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",kent.henderson@stonybrook.edu; kristen.shorette@stonybrook.edu,,,,,,,14,14,,,,,,,,,,,SUM-FAL,2017.0,23,2,,,,269,297,,10.5195/JWSR.2017.699,,,,,,,,WOS:000416751900004,

The three-dimensional reflectivity field is analyzed to define three types of extreme echo, deep convective cores, wide convective cores, and broad stratiform regions. The location and timing of these echoes are sensitive to midlatitude synoptic disturbances crossing the Andes. At the leading edges of these disturbances the nocturnal South American low-level jet (SALLJ) transports moisture along the eastern edge of the Andes from the tropical to the subtropical part of the continent. Where the SALLJ rises over lower but steep mountains on the east side of the southern central Andes, deep and wide convective cores are triggered in the evening. When the SALLJ withdraws to the north as the disturbance passes, nocturnal triggering occurs in the northeastern foothills of the central Andes. Extreme convection over the Amazon basin takes the form of broad stratiform regions that evolve from systems with wide convective cores moving into the center of the region from both the southwest and northeast. The systems from the northeast form at the northeast coast and are likely squall lines. Along the coast of the Brazilian Highlands, diurnal/topographic forcing leads to daytime maxima of deep convective cores followed a few hours later by wide convective cores. Wide convective cores and broad stratiform regions form in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) with a diurnal cycle related to continental heating.","[Romatschke, Ulrike; Houze, Robert A., Jr.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Romatschke, Ulrike] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria",,"Romatschke, U (corresponding author), Univ Washington, POB 351640, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",ulli@atmos.washington.edu,,,,,,,127,131,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2010.0,23,14,,,,3761,3791,,10.1175/2010JCLI3465.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000281280800001,

A total of 15,869 individuals and 37 species of palm were sampled in 10 terrace forest transects, while 3758 individuals and 21 species were sampled in two adjacent floodplain forest transects for comparison. The terrace and floodplain forest were clearly different in their diversity and floristic composition. The relative importance of geographical distance and environmental difference as controls of terrace forest beta diversity was scale dependent, with environmental differences, notably in soil moisture, dominating at local scales and geographical distance dominating at regional scales. In fact, none of the environmental factors had a significant influence on regional-scale beta diversity. The geographical distance decay in floristic similarity was markedly steeper at local scale (-0.25 km(-1)) than at regional scale (-0.003 km(-1)). Such a nonlinear decay is expected if simple dispersal limitation controls beta diversity. However, the absent flattening of the distance decay at the largest distances and the sub-Andean affinities of the westernmost palm communities suggest that large-scale biogeographical processes also contribute to the regional-scale beta diversity. Hereby our results indicate that not only local environment, but also dispersal limitation and biogeographical history can be important controls of the diversity and composition of local plant communities.","Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; Univ Nacl Amazonia Peruana, Iquitos, Peru",,"Balslev, H (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bldg 1540,Ny Munkegade, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",henrik.balslev@biology.au.dk,,,,,,,59,66,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2006.0,186,2,,,,161,176,,10.1007/s11258-006-9120-9,,,,,,,,WOS:000240399100002,

Miguel; Schindler, Seth",,,Peri-urban promises of connectivity: Linking project-led polycentrism to the infrastructure scramble,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper offers an interpretive framework linking polycentric urban expansion in emerging/frontier economies to the global extension of infrastructure networks. Drawing from scholarship on state restructuring, we theorize an infrastructure scramble whereby numerous state actors and agencies make massive investments in infrastructure connectivity to secure effective integration to transnational value chains as economic and geopolitical competition intensify. This has manifold territorial implications, and matters for debates on planetary urbanization. Novel urbanization processes include the proliferation of peri-urban nodes. Built in cheaply available land, these respond to (or anticipate economic gains from) enhanced connective infrastructure. In contrast to city-regional exemplars, project-led polycentrism does not arise from territorially decentralized governance arrangements, and may deepen peri-urban exclusion. The paper includes an experimental comparison of two peri-urban nodal projects: the Iranduba University City (IUC), located in a riparian rainforest of the Brazilian Amazon 17 miles from bustling Manaus, and the Bagamoyo Port and Special Economic Zone, located 35 miles north of the congested port of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's expansive capital. Our findings suggest that: (i) techno-entrepreneurial capacity requirements underpin the centralist scalar politics governing the development of peri-urban nodes; as (ii) state-led projects rely on ambitious physical planning, with masterplans evincing elite, globalization-oriented objectives that neglect local needs and trigger displacement and (iii) even failing projects spearhead varying trajectories of territorial transformation in erstwhile-stagnant peri-urban peripheries. Concluding, we call for further research on multiple drivers and modalities of polycentrism in the global South, and the infrastructure scramble's broad implications for hyper-connected and bypassed territories.","[Kanai, J.

Location Kaieteur National Park is located on eastern edge of the Potaro Plateau in central Guyana, South America. The species examined have distributions that vary from local to global. Methods The distribution patterns of the families, genera and species known from Kaieteur are examined using generalized distribution patterns. Results Data on distribution patterns, elevation and habitat were gathered from 131 flowering plant families, 517 genera and 1227 species. These plants represent all taxa that are currently known to occur in the area of the original Kaieteur National Park. Families tend to have cosmopolitan or pantropical distribution, genera are mostly neotropical and at the species level, most species are restricted to the Guiana Shield (c. 40%), northern South America (69%) or neotropical (96%) in distribution, each level inclusive of the previous. Conclusions The flora at the study site in Kaieteur National Park has its strongest affinity with the Guiana Shield; 42.1% of the species have a distribution that corresponds with the Shield or is more restricted within the Shield. There is a distinct flora on the Guiana Shield and its affinities lie with the flora of northern South American and beyond that, the neotropics. The flora is not closely affiliated with the floras of the Brazilian Shield, the Amazon, the Andes, the eastern coastal forests of Brazil, southern South America, or Africa as has been previous suggested.","Smithsonian Inst, MRC 166, Biol Divers Guianas Program, Washington, DC 20013 USA",,"Kelloff, CL (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, MRC 166, Biol Divers Guianas Program, POB 37012, Washington, DC 20013 USA.",kelloff.carol@nmnh.si.edu,,,,,,,24,31,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2004.0,31,3,,,,501,513,,10.1046/j.0305-0270.2003.01038.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000189232300014,

The DD profiles dominated tropical interior landmasses such as Africa and the Brazilian Plateau in summer. The DI profiles were observed over land in winter and over ocean except for regions with very little rainfall. In addition, DI profiles appeared during the height of the wet season even over the tropical landmasses, such as the mature monsoon period over inland India and over the Amazon River basin. Individual precipitation systems were also investigated in terms of their areally averaged DD and DI characteristics mainly over India. Deep ( shallow) profiles tended to be DD ( DI) for all seasons except the premonsoon season. As the rain area increased, the vertical gradient of rainfall rate decreased ( DD tendency). Embedded in the dominant DD signature for deep storms, deep but significant DI profiles were observed in every month. They characterized the precipitation in the premonsoon season. More than half of the mesoscale/synoptic-scale systems (rain areas > 10(4) km(2)) having the significant DD or DI regions had both of them as part of their slant cores. The vertical gradients for these systems had a similar trend for both their stratiform and convective parts.

Experimental one-hectare agroforestry plots were established on 50 small-scale farms in the western Brazilian Amazon State of Rondonia from 1993 to 1995. Drawing from a menu of 25 different species (10 tropical hardwoods and softwoods and 15 fruits and palms), this species trial shows encouraging survival and growth performance for most species under wide ranging plot management regimes. Tropical hardwood survival rates (after 18 months) ranged from 65% for Cerejeira (Torresea acreana) to 88% for mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla). Survival rates for commercial fruit and palm species were even higher. A comparison of attributes of two sub-groups (successful and unsuccessful planters) suggests that previous experience with perennial monocultural cropping, greater social participation, land use history, and soil chemistry are positively associated with successful agroforestry species performance, while no significant differences exist between successful and unsuccessful planters in household size, area deforested, area in pasture, and land tenure security. A closer analysis of 'failed' agroforestry plots indicates the primary importance of social factors originating at the household-level (e.g. inadequate plot maintenance, improper planting techniques, illness, etc.). Twelve different causes of plot failure were cited, falling into three classes. Of the total number of reasons given for plot failure, household level factors represented 54% of all causes cited. Project design and implementation factors (inappropriate plot design, defective planting material, etc.) were cited 25% of the times and environmental factors (soil fertility constraints and pasture grass invasion) were cited 21% of the times.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",,"Browder, JO (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,,29,29,,,,,,,,,,,,2000.0,49,1,,,,63,83,,10.1023/A:1006347019689,,,,,,,,WOS:000086317800006,

This study characterized the sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the processes affecting their distributions in a mangrove-influenced estuary located in French Guiana (FG), a region representative of these dynamic systems down drift of the Amazon River. Four sampling cruises were carried out between 2013 and 2015 in surface waters of the estuary during dry and wet seasons. Stable isotopes (delta(DOC)-D-13, delta(POC)-P-13, delta(DIC)-D-13), elemental ratios and optical properties (absorption) were used as proxies to identify different C sources. Property-salinity relationships revealed regions of approximately linear mixing (e.g., alkalinity) or net sources or sinks (e.g., DOC). DIC speciation and isotopic distributions demonstrated dynamic source-sink reaction processes within the estuary. DOC was the major form of organic carbon representing mixtures of terrestrial sources (e.g., pore water, litter leaching) and very high concentration (400-800 A mu M) compared to other mangrove settings (e.g. Brazilian, Sundarbans, African). Highly negative delta(POC)-P-13 (- 40aEuro degrees) in the riverine part presumably suggests the role of freshwater phytoplankton in the dry season and methanotrophic sources derived from senescent mangrove deposits or upstream hydrothermal dam during the wet season. Microphytobenthos and marine phytoplankton were the primary sources of POC inshore and DOC offshore, respectively. Mangrove products and benthic microalgae dominated estuarine sources of C in FG coastal waters (similar to 10 km, inner shelf region), and there was extensive exchange of C between forest and tidal flat and the estuarine reservoirs.","[Ray, R.; Michaud, E.; Devesa, J.; Le Goff, M.; Thouzeau, G.] Inst Univ Europeen Mer, UBO CNRS IRD Ifremer, Lab Sci Environm Marin LEMAR, UMR 6539, Rue Dumont Urville, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Aller, R.

In other words, it is a highly political concept, and its utility depends on the arena in which it is used and what it is used for. Following a political ecology framework, and based on a literature review, bibliometric analyses, and brief examples from two tropical rainforest countries, this review investigates four moments in the construction and application of the ecosystem services idea: socio-historical (the emergence of the discourse), ontological (what knowledge does the concept allow?), scientific (difficulties in its practical application), and political (who wins, who loses?). We show how the concept is a boundary object with widespread appeal, trace the discursive and institutional context within which it gained traction, and argue that choices of scale, definition, and method in measuring ecosystem services frustrate its straightforward application. As a result, it is used in diverse ways by different interests to justify different kinds of interventions that at times might be totally opposed. In Madagascar, the ecosystem services ideals mainly used to justify forest conservation in ways open to critique for its neoliberalization of nature or disempowerment of communities. In contrast, in the Brazilian Amazon, the discourse of ecosystem services has served the agendas of traditional populations and family farm lobbies. Ecosystem services, as an idea and tool, are mobilized by diverse actors in real-life situations that lead to complex, regionally particular and fundamentally political outcomes.

In agroforestry systems of cultivation, cacao is subjected to excess shade due to high density, excess growth, and the unmanaged pruning of shade trees. Cacao is tolerant to shade, and the maximum photosynthetic rate occurs at an irradiance of around 400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, excess shade further reduces the irradiance, which is detrimental to photosynthesis and growth functions. Intra-specific variation is known to exist in cacao for the required saturation irradiance. A greenhouse study was implemented with 58 cacao genotypes selected from four geographically diverse groups: (i) wild cacao from river basins of the Peruvian Amazon (PWC); (ii) Peruvian farmers' collection (PFC); (iii) Brazilian cacao collection (BCC); and (iv) national and international cacao collections (NIC). All of the cacao genotypes were subjected to 50% and 80% shade where photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was 1000 and 400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Intra-specific variations were observed for growth, physiological and nutritional traits, and tolerance to shade.

The few sampled populations of this broadly distributed trans-Amazonian arboreal rat have come from widely separated regions and are typically highly divergent. The holotype was described in 1817 by A.-G. Desmarest, after Napoleon's army brought it to Paris following the plunder of Lisbon in 1808; however, the locality of origin has remained unknown. Here we examine the taxonomic status of this species by direct comparison of 50 extant individuals with the holotype at the morphometric and genetic levels, the latter based on 331 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene retrieved from a small skin fragment of the holotype with ancient DNA technology. Extensive sequence divergence is present among samples of M. hispidus collected from throughout its range, from French Guiana across Amazonia to Bolivia and Peru, with at least seven mitochondrial clades recognized (average divergence of 7.7% Kimura 2-parameter distance). Sequence from the holotype is, however, only weakly divergent from those of recent samples from French Guiana. Moreover, the holotype clusters with greater that 99% posterior probability with samples from this part of Amazonia in a discriminant analysis based on 22 cranial and dental measurements. Thus, we suggest that the holotype was originally obtained in eastern Amazonia north of the Amazon River, most likely in the Brazilian state of Amapa. Despite the high level of sequence diversity and marked morphological differences in size across the range of M. hispidus, we continue to regard this assemblage as a single species until additional samples and analyses suggest otherwise.

We used biogeographic predictions derived from geomorphological history and contemporary hydrochemical and genetic data to examine cryptic diversity in the Amazonian driftwood catfish Centromochlus existimatus. Using both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers, five deeply divergent cryptic lineages are reported, for which at least three are sympatric in distribution. These lineages appear relatively old, with divergence times dating back to middle Miocene. Diversification events appear to be chronologically associated with the formation of the modern Amazon River system, and perhaps influenced by hydrochemical gradients between tributaries. The cause of apparent morphological stasis in the C. existimatus species complex is speculated within the context of hydrochemistry and non-visual mating cues and a full taxonomic revision is recommended.

We uncovered phylogenetic relationships between taxa and patterns of population structure that are discordant with both morphology and current taxonomy. For example, we found deep genetic breaks between taxa in the ornata group that are currently regarded as species, and in the haematonota and leucophthalma groups we found paraphyly at the species and subspecies levels, respectively. As has been found in many Amazonian taxa, our phylogenetic results show that the major river systems of the Amazon Basin appear to have an effect on the genetic structure and range limits within Epinecrophylla.

ET varied typically between similar to 7 and 10 cm/month with exception of the Xingu basin for which it varied between 10 and 15 cm/month. Outstanding features of ET seasonality are (i) generally weak seasonality, (ii) two ET peaks for the two very wet catchments Solimoes and Negro, with one occurring during the wet season and one during the drier season, and (iii) a steady increase of ET during the second half of the dry season for the three drier catchments (Madeira, Tapajos, Xingu). Peak ET occurs during the first half of the wet season consistent with leaf flush occurring before the onset of the wet season. With regards to inter-annual variation, we found firstly that for the Solimoes and Madeira catchments the period with large positive wet season anomalies (2012-2015) is associated with negative ET anomalies, and negative SIF (solar induced fluorescence) anomalies. Furthermore, we found negative ET of several cm/months and SIF (up to 50%) anomalies for most of the Amazon basin during the 2015/16 El Nino event suggesting down-regulation of productivity as a main factor of positive carbon flux anomalies during anomalously hot and dry conditions.

A nutrient stock analysis,PLANT AND SOIL,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Nutrient-poor soils often support low-stature grasslands, savannas and shrublands where the climate is warm enough and wet enough for closed forests. Though this pattern has long been recognised, the causes are debated and poorly explored. I tested the hypothesis that forest fails to develop where the total nutrient pool is too small to construct both the foliage and the wood. I estimated potential woody biomass from the difference between soil nutrient stocks and forest foliage stocks. Nutrient stocks required for foliage were estimated from leaf tissue concentrations and foliage biomass typical of Amazon forests. Potential wood biomass was estimated from wood nutrient concentrations typical of Amazon forests. Data on soil nutrient stocks were assembled from studies from South American and African forests and savannas and from south-western Australian and south-west African heathlands. According to these calculations, estimated nutrient stocks (kg ha(-1)) to build a forest would need to be > = P: 20-30, K 200-350, Ca 300-600 and Mg 55-65. Many surface soil horizons from both savanna and heathland sites were below these thresholds. However when deeper soil layers were included, most soils had adequate nutrient stocks. The nutrients in shortest supply were Ca and K and not P. This study suggests that nutrient stocks are usually adequate for constructing the wood needed to build a forest, except where soils are highly leached and very shallow. The implication is that, at steady state, low nutrient stocks seldom constrain forest development. The apparent failure of low nutrient stocks to explain the missing forests on nutrient-poor soils emphasises the need for new ideas on how nutrients, alone or in combination with other factors such as fire, influence vegetation structure.","Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",,"Bond, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",William.bond@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,81,82,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2010.0,334,1-2,,,,47,60,,10.1007/s11104-010-0440-0,,,,,,,,WOS:000281055700004,

We assessed the response of the element budget of three microcatchments (8 - 13 ha) to the variations in atmospheric deposition between the intensive burning season and outside the burning season in Amazonia. There were significantly elevated H, N, and Mn depositions during biomass burning. Elevated H deposition during biomass burning caused elevated base metal loss from the canopy and the organic horizon and deteriorated already low base metal supply of the vegetation. N was only retained during biomass burning but not during nonfire conditions when deposition was much smaller. We conclude that biomass burning-related aerosol emissions in Amazonia are large enough to substantially increase element deposition at the western rim of Amazonia. Particularly the related increase of acid deposition impoverishes already base metal scarce ecosystems. As biomass burning is most intense during El Nino situations, a shortened El Nino - Southern Oscillation cycle because of global warming likely enhances the acid deposition at our study forest.","[Boy, Jens; Wilcke, Wolfgang] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geog, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Rollenbeck, Ruetger] Univ Marburg, Inst Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Valarezo, Carlos] Univ Nacl Loja, Direcc Gen Invest, Loja, Ecuador",,"Boy, J (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geog, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",wolfgang.wilcke@uni-mainz.de,,,,,,,89,90,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 18,2008.0,22,4,,,,,,GB4011,10.1029/2007GB003158,,,,,,,,WOS:000261143800001,

Several studies have already estimated carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, but the estimates vary greatly and are difficult to compare due to differences in data sources, assumptions, and methodologies. In this paper, we review the different estimates and datasets, and the various challenges associated with comparing them and with accurately estimating carbon emissions from deforestation. We performed a simulation study over legal Amazonia to illustrate some of these major issues. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of considering land-cover dynamics following deforestation, including the fluxes from reclearing of secondary vegetation, the decay of product and slash pools, and the fluxes from regrowing forest. It also suggests that accurate carbon-flux estimates will need to consider historical land-cover changes for at least the previous 20 years. However, this result is highly sensitive to estimates of the partitioning of cleared carbon into instantaneous burning vs. long-timescale slash pools. We also show that carbon flux estimates based on 'committed flux' calculations, as used by a few studies, are not comparable with the 'annual balance' calculation method used by other studies.","McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, SAGE, Madison, WI 53726 USA; European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, VA, Italy; Univ Maryland, Dept Geog, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA",,"Ramankutty, N (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",navin.ramankutty@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,245,256,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2007.0,13,1,,,,51,66,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01272.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000243403900005,

However, the impact of imperfect tests on adjusted odds ratios (and thus on the identification of risk factors) is under-appreciated. The purpose of this article is to draw attention to the problem associated with modelling imperfect diagnostic tests, and propose simple Bayesian models to adequately address this issue. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to determine the proportion of malaria studies that appropriately accounted for false-negatives/false-positives in a logistic regression setting. Inference from the standard logistic regression was also compared with that from three proposed Bayesian models using simulations and malaria data from the western Brazilian Amazon. Results: A systematic literature review suggests that malaria epidemiologists are largely unaware of the problem of using logistic regression to model imperfect diagnostic test results. Simulation results reveal that statistical inference can be substantially improved when using the proposed Bayesian models versus the standard logistic regression. Finally, analysis of original malaria data with one of the proposed Bayesian models reveals that microscopy sensitivity is strongly influenced by how long people have lived in the study region, and an important risk factor (i.e., participation in forest extractivism) is identified that would have been missed by standard logistic regression. Conclusion: Given the numerous diagnostic methods employed by malaria researchers and the ubiquitous use of logistic regression to model the results of these diagnostic tests, this paper provides critical guidelines to improve data analysis practice in the presence of misclassification error. Easy-to-use code that can be readily adapted to Win-BUGS is provided, enabling straightforward implementation of the proposed Bayesian models.","[Valle, Denis; Lima, Joanna M.

Driven by plans to generate economic revenue, large-scale plantations are emerging in Southeast Asia, Africa and Brazilian Amazon. However, the ecological impacts of the sector are poorly studied with respect to oil palm management system, and recommended conservation measures are based on limited data. We studied avifauna in oil palm landscapes in Peninsular Malaysia under different management systems (large plantation estates versus smallholdings) and age classes (uniform age versus mixed-age stands). We sampled 41 large plantation estates and 14 smallholdings, as well as 20 sites in an extensively logged peat swamp forest, the type of natural forest prior to conversion to oil palms. Compared with logged peat swamp forest, our results showed that forest conversion to oil palm cultivation may have eliminated 48-60% of bird species. We also found: (i) plantation estates and smallholdings supported similar bird assemblages but the latter supported significantly more species (P = 0.007); and (ii) despite reduced species richness in oil palm landscapes, we found high abundance of some individual bird species in specific types of stands including some forest, migratory, and wetland species. Conversion of natural forest to oil palm landscapes should not occur in the future through clearing of primary or secondary native forests. To complement conventional conservation approaches (e.g. the establishment of protected areas) in palm oil-producing countries, existing plantation estates and smallholdings should be managed in ways to promote improved conservation outcomes, although oil palm landscapes maintained a fraction of the original forest biodiversity. Managing habitat heterogeneity at both a local and a landscape-level is highly recommended in oil palm landscapes to maintain and/or enhance avian biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The experiment was carried out as a precursor to the use of SSiB in a South American Land Data Assimilation System (SALDAS). The results from an 11 year long recursive simulation using three different initial conditions of soil wetness ( control, wet and dry) are examined. The control run was initiated by interpolation of the NCEP/DOE Global Reanalysis-2 (NCEP/DOE R- 2) soil moisture data set. In each case the time required for the model to reach equilibrium was calculated. The wet initialization leads to a faster adjustment of the soil moisture field, followed by the control and then the dry initialization. Overall, the final spin-up states using the SSiB-based SALDAS are generally wetter than both the NCEP/DOE R- 2 and the Centro de Previsao do Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC - Brazilian Center for Weather Forecast and Climate Studies) operational initial soil moisture states, consequently modeled latent heat is higher and sensible heat lower in the final year of simulation when compared with the first year. Selected regions, i.e., in semiarid northeastern Brazil, the transition zone to the south of the Amazon tropical forest, and the central Andes were studied in more detail because they took longer to spin up ( up to 56 months) when compared with other areas ( less than 24 months). It is shown that there is a rapid change in the soil moisture in all layers in the first 2 months of simulation followed by a subsequent slow and steady adjustment: This could imply there are increasing errors in medium range simulations. Spin-up is longest where frozen soil is present for long periods such as in the central Andes.","Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Met Off Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; Inst Global Environm & Soc, Ctr Res Environm & Water, Calverton, MD 20705 USA; George Mason Univ, Climate Dynam Program, Calverton, MD 20705 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Branch, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",,"de Goncalves, LGG (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Branch, Code 614-3, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",gustavo@hwr.arizona.edu,,,,,,,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 13,2006.0,111,D17,,,,,,D17110,10.1029/2005JD006297,,,,,,,,WOS:000240643700001,

In this introduction to the collection, we first describe the 'neo-nature' of the soy complex and the political economy of the sector in South America, including the new corporate actors and financial mechanisms that produced some of the world's largest agricultural production companies. We then discuss key environmental debates surrounding soy agribusiness in South America, challenging especially the common arguments that agroindustrial intensification 'spares land' for conservation while increasing production to 'feed the world'. We demonstrate that these arguments hinge on limited data from a peculiar portion of the southern Amazon fringe, and obfuscate through neo-Malthusian concerns multiple other political and ecological problems associated with the sector. Thus, discussions of soy production become intertwined with broader debates about agrarian development, industrialization and modernization.

Recently, the advent of modern space-borne microwave radiometers like SMAP in addition to the trend towards open data for scientific use fostered the development of enhanced models based on data fusion from different platforms permitting more accurate assessments. SMAP was designed to operate on an integrated combination of a radiometer and a radar, both operating in L-band. Unexpected failure of the radar component encouraged scientists to experiment various combination of data from the surviving radiometer with other sources of radar data, notably C-band Sentinel-1 data. In this work, we present a case study on a possible combination of SMAP radiometer data with X-band radar data from TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed, comparing results with those provided by NASA from their standard production procedures. The study was performed on two test sites, one at an agricultural site in Germany and one in the Brazilian Amazon, to explore very different vegetation conditions. This work is a part of a broader research effort addressing the combination of multiple sources of passive and active microwave sensing data. The research question defining this research effort is whether the use of data from multiple active sources affords either obtaining more accurate estimates of active-passive co-variation parameters for a given observation period, or shortening the minimum observation period by increasing the temporal density of active samples. In this framework, this paper addresses a preliminary comparison of fresh and past results obtained from C-, X-, and L-band active sensing data.

Many ant species inhabit areas where flooding occasionally occurs. For example, Lasius flavus (FABRICIUS, 1782) nests on tidal meadows with unpredictable winter flooding, and they survive the inundation due to their low metabolic activity and to small air bubbles trapped in the soil. Other species, such as Formica selysi BONDROIT, 1918, survive flooding by forming swimming rafts of ants and brood and drift to dry environment. The ant communities in regularly inundated habitats of the Brazilian Amazon move their colonies up in the trees during the months of flooding. In tropical mangroves, another regularly inundated habitat, some ant species live under conditions where several environmental factors are extreme all the year round. Ants nesting in the tidal part of the mangrove need to select a nesting behavior which prevents them from drowning. The Australian ant Polyrhachis sokolova FOREL, 1902 escapes the flooding in small air pockets in their galleries in the mangrove mud, whereas the intrusion of water to the twig nesting Australian ant Camponotus anderseni MCARTHUR & SHATTUCK, 2001 is prevented by a soldier blocking the entrance hole during the inundation. The exclusion of water also prevents gas exchange, and in the nests of C. anderseni, the CO2 concentration can reach very high levels of > 30% and conditions can become anoxic. Camponotus anderseni can reduce its metabolism (measured as CO2 production) to about 1% of normal metabolism when the CO2 concentration reaches about 25%. Mangrove ants can shift to anaerobic metabolism, which has not been demonstrated for other social insects. The benefits for the ants living under these extreme conditions are mainly lack of competition for nesting sites and food.","Univ Aarhus, Dept Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,"Nielsen, MG (corresponding author), Univ Aarhus, Dept Biol, Bldg 1131, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",biomgn@biology.au.dk,,,,,,,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2011.0,14,,,,,113,121,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000286844100014,

These drainage systems constantly changed shape and size. During the entire Cenozoic, the Brazilian and Guiana Shields were stable mountainous areas. Andean-derived river systems increased in importance especially in the Neogene. A remarkable feature in western Amazonian history is the waxing and waning of large lake systems and embayments. By the Late Miocene (about 11 Ma), the Andes were connected with the Atlantic through an incipient Amazon River, and from c. 7 Ma Andean-derived river systems became fully established in central and eastern Amazonia and the modern landscape configuration had developed. Rainforests already existed in northern South America during the Paleogene, but the modern rainforests - with resemblance to the Present forest only developed during the Miocene. The western Amazonian Miocene record contains very diverse aquatic faunas (molluscs, ostracods, turtles, crocodiles, fishes) as well as terrestrial mammals. Remarkable gigantic forms thrived in Amazonian ecosystems at the time. Since the Late Miocene, edaphically heterogeneous lands emerged in western Amazonia in areas previously occupied by lake systems. At the same time nutrient-rich deposits spread over central and eastern Amazonia, an event that, based on molecular phylogenetic studies on extant taxa, coincided with diversification of terrestrial taxa. Molecular-based time estimates confirm the steady diversification and mostly pre-Quaternary origin of extant Amazonian taxa. A significant portion of the current species richness is attributed to a combination of relatively constant wet and warm climates and a heterogeneous edaphic substrate. The Quaternary was a time of distribution shifts, but can no longer be considered a time of diversification in Amazonia.","[Wesselingh, Frank P.] Naturalis, Leiden, Netherlands; [Hoorn, Carina] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Anal, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kroonenberg, Salomon B.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Geotechnol, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Antonelli, Alexandre] Univ Zurich, Inst Systemat Bot, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Antonelli, Alexandre] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lundberg, John G.] Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia, Dept Ichthyol, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA; [Vonhof, Hubert B.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Dept Sedimentol & Marine Geol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hooghiemstra, Henry] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Wesselingh, FP (corresponding author), Naturalis, Leiden, Netherlands.",wesselingh@naturalis.nnm.nl; carina.hoorn@milne.cc; s.b.kroonenberg@tudelft.nl; alexandre.antonelli@systbot.uzh.ch; lundberg@acnatsci.org; vonh@falw.vu.nl; h.hooghiemstra@uva.nl,,,,,,,66,71,,,,,,,,,,,,2010.0,,,,,,421,431,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000337463900027,

Carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are measured simultaneously using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). Atmospheric aerosol particles were collected at the Brazilian Antarctic Station and at biomass burning sites in the Amazon basin tropical rain forest in Brazil. In the Antarctic samples, the sea-salt aerosol particles were clearly predominating, with NaCl and CaSO4 as major compounds with several trace elements as Al, Si, P, K, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Sr, and Pb.

We modeled their potential distribution using the maximum entropy algorithm implemented in Maxent and calculated distances to their niche centroid by fitting a minimum-volume ellipsoid. In addition, to determine which method would accurately explain geographic abundance patterns, we compared the correlation between population abundance and the distance to the ecological niche centroid (DNC) and between population abundance and Maxent environmental suitability. The potential distribution estimated for T. maculata showed that environmental suitability covers a large area, from Panama to Northern Brazil. R. pallescens showed a more restricted potential distribution, with environmental suitability covering mostly the coastal zone of Costa Rica and some areas in Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, northern Colombia, Acre, and Rondonia states in Brazil, as well as a small region of the western Brazilian Amazon. We found a negative slope in the relationship between population abundance and the DNC in both species. R. pallecens has a more extensive potential latitudinal range than previously reported, and the distribution model for T. maculata corroborates previous studies. In addition, population abundance increases according to the niche centroid proximity, indicating that population abundance is limited by the set of scenopoetic variables at coarser scales (non-interactive variables) used to determine the ecological niche. These findings might be used by public health agencies in Latin America to implement actions and support programs for disease prevention and vector control, identifying areas in which to expand entomological surveillance and maintain chemical control, in order to decrease human-vector contact.","[Altamiranda-Saavedra, Mariano; Parra-Henao, Gabriel] Univ Cooperat Colombia, Ctr Invest Salud Trop CIST, Santa Marta, Colombia; [Altamiranda-Saavedra, Mariano] Politecn Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid, Medellin, Antioquia, Colombia; [Osorio-Olvera, Luis] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Yanez-Arenas, Carlos] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Ecol Geog, Unidad Conservac Biodiversidad, UMDI Sisal,Fac Ciencias, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Carlos Marin-Ortiz, Juan] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias Agr, Dept Ciencias Agr, Medellin, Colombia; [Parra-Henao, Gabriel] Natl Hlth Inst, Bogota, Colombia",,"Altamiranda-Saavedra, M (corresponding author), Univ Cooperat Colombia, Ctr Invest Salud Trop CIST, Santa Marta, Colombia.; Altamiranda-Saavedra, M (corresponding author), Politecn Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid, Medellin, Antioquia, Colombia.",maltamiranda2@gmail.com,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 4,2020.0,15,11,,,,,,e0241710,10.1371/journal.pone.0241710,,,,,,,,WOS:000589609300074,

Results of detrended correspondence analyses (DCA) and two-way indicator species analyses (TWINSPAN) clearly revealed the presence of a striking faunal change (i.e., about 92% dissimilarity) between beach-zone and off-shore fishes. The boundary between these assemblages occurred at about 2 m depth. Beach samples collected as far apart as 325 km were more similar to each other than to trawl samples taken only 10s of meters away. The beach-zone fish assemblage was strongly dominated by small characins, whereas the deep-river habitat was dominated by catfishes and weakly electric gymnotiforms. Apparent adaptations to deep-water habitats included small size, flattened or elongated body, ventral months, reduced eyes, and sensory specializations for life in what may be a nearly light-less environment (e.g., chemo- and electroreceptors). Visually oriented fishes and those dependent on algal or detrital foods were mostly absent from the deep-river samples. We caught many more species along the beaches, but after correcting for higher numbers of individuals collected in beach habitats, species richness was not noticeably different between the two habitats. Species diversity also averaged slightly higher for beach samples, but the difference was not significant. We infer that the deep-river habitat was undersampled and that further effort in the deep river would reveal the presence of many more species.","SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; Escuela Politec Nacl, Dept Ciencias Biol, Quito, Ecuador",,"Stewart, DJ (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",djstewar@mailbox.syr.edu,,,,,,,26,27,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 21,2002.0,,2,,,,333,343,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000175771000006,

The assessment consists of eighteen runs for a section of the Transamazon Highway in the lower basin, where the BLM's simulated deforestation map for each run is compared to a reference map of 1999. The BLM simulates the transition from forest to non-forest in a spatially explicit manner in 20-m x 20-m pixels. The pixels are nested within a hierarchical stratification structure of household lots within larger development rectangles that emanate from the Transamazon Highway. Each of the eighteen runs derives from a unique combination of three model parameters. We have derived novel methods of assessment to consider (1) the nested stratification structure, (2) multiple resolutions, (3) a simpler model that predicts deforestation near the highway, (4) a null model that predicts forest persistence, and (5) a uniform model that has accuracy equal to the expected accuracy of a random spatial allocation. Results show that the model's specification of the overall quantity of non-forest is the most important factor that constrains and correlates with accuracy. A large source of location agreement is the BLM's assumption that deforestation within household lots occurs near roads. A large source of location disagreement is the BLM's less than perfect ability to simulate the proportion of deforestation by household lot.

As parts of agricultural product supply chains, land use (LU) and land use change (LUC) are considered to be major contributors to global CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, LU and LUC (LULUC) are rarely included in GHG estimations for food and feedstuffs. Here we propose a method which can be used to derive emissions from LU and LUC on a regional level. Emissions are distributed over an accounting period chosen to match the physically occurring carbon fluxes. As fluxes from soil organic carbon persist for years or even for decades after a LUC episode, depending on the climatic conditions of the region, we apply 10 and 20 years as suitable accounting periods for tropical and temperate climate zones, respectively. We compare the proposed method with two other methods proposed in the literature. Using two types of feedstuffs (Brazilian soybean-meal and Austrian barley) as examples, we find that the other two methods produce mostly lower emission estimates in the case of Brazilian soybeans, and higher estimates for Austrian barley. We conclude that these differences are caused mainly by different accounting periods and by a (non)consideration of regional specificities. While analysing life cycles necessarily entails a well supported but still arbitrary setting of such system boundaries, we argue that the methodology presented here better reflects actually occurring carbon fluxes that we understand to be the foundation of any environmental product assessment.

Gold mining, which releases the metal during the amalgamation process and erodes soils naturally rich in mercury, is regarded as the main contamination source. Here, we present the results of a comparative study of mercury distribution in the water and fish of two adjacent rivers in French Guiana, with and without gold mining activities. As a consequence of a marked difference in suspended particulate matter between the two systems, total mercury concentrations in unfiltered water samples were higher in the mined river (25.4-34.9 ng L-1) as compared to the reference one (2.1-5.4 ng L-1). Surprisingly, no significant differences were observed in mercury concentrations between 13 common fish species at upstream sites. In sharp contrast, mercury concentration of fish caught downstream a hydroelectric reservoir, where the two rivers flow, was up to 8-fold higher than that upstream. Mercury speciation measurements allowed one to relate these differences in fish to the water distribution of monomethylmercury, the mercury chemical species that biornagnifies along aquatic foodwebs. Indeed, mean dissolved monomethylmercury concentrations were low and similar in both rivers (0.03-0.06 ng L-1), while they were 10 times higher (up to 0.56 ng L-1) in the water outflowing the hydroelectric dam. Dissolved monomethylmercury determinations along a water column profile suggest that methylation of inorganic mercury occurs in the deep anoxic part in reservoir. We conclude that mercury mobilization related to gold mining is not solely sufficient to account for high concentrations in fish and that environmental conditions that favor mercury methylation, such as anoxia, are needed.","Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, UMR 5805, LEESA, F-33120 Arcachon, France; Marine Environm Lab, IAIEA, MC-98000 Monaco, Monaco; IFREMER, F-44311 Nantes, France",,"Boudou, A (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, UMR 5805, LEESA, F-33120 Arcachon, France.",a.boudou@epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr,,,,,,,62,63,,,,,,,,,,,APR 15,2005.0,39,8,,,,2448,2454,,10.1021/es049149r,,,,,,,,WOS:000228428900011,

On the basis of 20 0.25 ha plots (10 m x 250 m) in both burnt and unburnt forest, we found marked differences in the overall live biomass, canopy openness and understorey vegetation. On average, 36% of all trees equal to or greater than 10 cm DBH were found to be dead in the burnt forest, and there was also a near-complete mortality in all pre-burn saplings. Using an allometric equation to predict biomass mortality we estimate that the tree mortality rates found would commit an additional 25.5 t C/ha to be released from these BFs. The dramatic increase of aboveground dead biomass in BF is of major global concern because of the increased flux Of CO2 to the atmosphere, which has a role in enhancing the greenhouse effect and promoting climate change.

We introduce a model with hydraulically interpretable parameters for estimating SFD rating curves and their uncertainties. Conventional power functions for channel and section controls are used. The transition to a backwater-affected channel control is computed based on a continuity condition, solved either analytically or numerically. The practical use of the method is demonstrated with two real twin-gauge stations, the Rhone River at Valence, France, and the Guthusbekken stream at station 00030033, Norway. Those stations are typical of a channel control and a section control, respectively, when backwater-unaffected conditions apply. The performance of the method is investigated through sensitivity analysis to prior information on controls and to observations (i.e., available gaugings) for the station of Valence. These analyses suggest that precisely identifying SFD rating curves requires adapted gauging strategy and/or informative priors. The Madeira River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon, provides a challenging case typical of large, flat, tropical river networks where bed roughness can also be variable in addition to slope. In this case, the difference in staff gauge reference levels must be estimated as another uncertain parameter of the SFD model. The proposed Bayesian method is a valuable alternative solution to the graphical and empirical techniques still proposed in hydrometry guidance and standards.","[Mansanarez, V.; Le Coz, J.; Renard, B.; Lang, M.] Irstea, UR HHLY, Hydrol Hydraul, Villeurbanne, France; [Pierrefeu, G.] Compagnie Natl Rhone, Lyon, France; [Vauchel, P.] IRD GET, Toulouse, France",,"Mansanarez, V (corresponding author), Irstea, UR HHLY, Hydrol Hydraul, Villeurbanne, France.",valentin.mansanarez@irstea.fr,,,,,,,16,16,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2016.0,52,9,,,,7424,7443,,10.1002/2016WR018916,,,,,,,,WOS:000386977900040,

Sandstones of the Eastern Cordillera have a dominant input of Brazilian-age zircons (0.7-0.5 Ga) with two prominent peaks at around 0.52-0.58 Ga and 0.61-0.67 Ga. A prevailing eastern source (Brazilian Shield, Amazonian Craton) is inferred. In contrast, sandstones from the Coastal Cordillera and Altiplano have major inputs of Famatinian (0.5-0.4 Ga), Grenvillian (1.2-0.9 Ga) and occasionally zircons of 1.85-1.75 Ga crystallisation ages. Here, a dominant provenance from the Arequipa Massif is likely. Zircons preserving a juvenile component with epsilon Hf-(t) values range from about + 12 to + 6 are limited to crystallisation ages between 1.45 and 1.0 Ga. All younger grains have lower epsilon Hf-(t) values consistent with recycling of old crust without juvenile additions during the Neoproterozoic.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a literature review to summarize the TB burden in indigenous peoples, identify gaps in current knowledge, and provide the foundation for a research agenda prioritizing indigenous health within TB control. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified articles published between January 1990 and November 2011 quantifying TB disease burden in indigenous populations worldwide. RESULTS: Among the 91 articles from 19 countries included in the review, only 56 were from outside Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The majority of the studies showed higher TB rates among indigenous groups than non-indigenous groups. Studies from the Amazon generally reported the highest TB prevalence and incidence, but select populations from South-East Asia and Africa were found to have similarly high rates of TB. In North America, the Inuit had the highest reported TB incidence (156/100000), whereas the Metis of Canada and American Indians/Alaska Natives experienced rates of <10/100000. New Zealand's Maori and Pacific Islanders had higher TB incidence rates than Australian Aborigines, but all were at greater risk of developing TB than non-indigenous groups. CONCLUSION: Where data exist, indigenous peoples were generally found to have higher rates of TB disease than non-indigenous peoples; however, this burden varied greatly. The paucity of published information on TB burden among indigenous peoples highlights the need to implement and improve TB surveillance to better measure and understand global disparities in TB rates.","[Tollefson, D.] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Bloss, E.; McCray, E.] US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; [Fanning, A.] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada; [Redd, J.

Even for narrow swath sensors like Landsat TM/ETM+, the influence of reflectance anisotropy can be sufficiently strong to introduce a cross track reflectance gradient. If the BRDF could be assumed to be linear for the limited swath of Landsat, it would be possible to remove this gradient during image preprocessing using a simple empirical method. However, the existence of natural gradients in reflectance caused by spatial variation in floristic composition of the forest can restrict the applicability of such simple corrections. Here we use floristic information over Peruvian and Brazilian Amazonia acquired through field surveys, complemented with information from geological maps, to investigate the interaction of real floristic gradients and the effect of reflectance anisotropy on the observed reflectances in Landsat data. In addition, we test the assumption of linearity of the BRDF for a limited swath width, and whether different primary non-inundated forest types are characterized by different magnitudes of the directional reflectance gradient. Our results show that a linear function is adequate to empirically correct for view angle effects, and that the magnitude of the across-track reflectance gradient is independent of floristic composition in the non-inundated forests we studied. This makes a routine correction of view angle effects possible. However, floristic variation complicates the issue, because different forest types have different mean reflectances. This must be taken into account when deriving the correction function in order to avoid eliminating natural gradients. (C) 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The aim of this article is to provide a bibliometric analysis of the available scientific literature relating to the remote sensing of wetlands in South America. From 1960 to 2015, 153 articles were published in 63 different journals, with the number of articles published per year increasing progressively since 1990. This rise is also paralleled by an increase in the contribution of local authors. The most intensively studied regions are the wetland macrosystems of South American mega-rivers: the Amazon and Parana Rivers, along with the Pantanal at the headwaters of Paraguay River. Few studies spanned more than two countries. The most frequent objectives were mapping, covering all types of wetlands with optical data, and hydrology, focusing on floodplain wetlands with microwave data as the preferred data source. The last decade substantial growth reflects an increase in technological and scientific capacities. Nevertheless, the state of the art regarding the remote sensing of wetlands in South America remains enigmatic. Fundamental questions and guidelines which may contribute to the understanding of the functioning of these ecosystems are yet to be fully defined and there is considerable dispersion in the use of data and remote-sensing approaches.","[Kandus, Patricia; Gail Minotti, Priscilla; Soledad Morandeira, Natalia; Grimson, Rafael; Gonzalez Trilla, Gabriela; Belen Gonzalez, Eliana; San Martin, Laura; Patricia Gayol, Maira] Univ Nacl San Martin UNSAM, 3iA, LETyE, Campus Miguelete,25 Mayo & Francia, RA-1650 San Martin, Argentina; [Soledad Morandeira, Natalia; Grimson, Rafael; Gonzalez Trilla, Gabriela; Belen Gonzalez, Eliana; San Martin, Laura; Patricia Gayol, Maira] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Kandus, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl San Martin UNSAM, 3iA, LETyE, Campus Miguelete,25 Mayo & Francia, RA-1650 San Martin, Argentina.",pkandus@unsam.edu.ar,,,,,,,18,19,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,39,4,,,,993,1016,,10.1080/01431161.2017.1395971,,,,,,,,WOS:000419349800004,

In this study, a three-stage conceptual model for the onset of the South American monsoon season is proposed based on a rain threshold analysis and a rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) analysis of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project version 2 (GPCP-v2) dataset. This two-pronged approach allowed the identification of regions of South America that share a common seasonal cycle of rainfall variability and likely have a common mechanism for monsoon onset. According to this model, the first stage of onset starts around pentad 59 (October 18-22) when precipitation begins in the northwestern part of the continent and gradually progresses towards the south and southeast. The second stage is marked by the abrupt establishment of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). This stage occurs on average around pentad 61 (October 28-November 1). The third stage of monsoon onset involves the late arrival of the monsoon to the mouth of the Amazon River, associated with the slow migration of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This final stage of onset occurs on average by pentad 73 (December 27-31). This three-stage model of onset provides a useful framework for the study of regional differences in monsoon onset mechanisms, a subject that is further explored in two companion studies.

This species is especially threatened in South America due to bycatch by fisheries along the northeastern coasts. It is particularly crucial to identify specific marine areas for conservation measures to safeguard green turtle rookeries in Suriname and French Guiana. Our study provides valuable information to attain this goal, describing the satellite tracking of post-nesting migration routes used by 16 green turtles fitted with Argos/GPS Fastloc satellite tags at the end of the nesting season. The data we obtained show a single migratory corridor: all the turtles followed a similar eastward route along the Guianan and the Brazilian coast. The GPS signal was lost for two individuals a few weeks after tracking commenced, suggesting that they were caught by fishermen. Thirteen turtles reached the coast of the state of Ceara (Brazil), where they spent at least one month. One turtle continued 700 km further to the coastal regions of Natal and Recife (Brazil), which are known feeding areas of the green turtle populations nesting on Ascension Island. The migratory corridor is essentially narrow, with a width of 22 km for most of the distance covered. It constitutes a major dynamic link between the nesting and feeding areas and crosses three Regional Management Units of the Atlantic basin. Since green turtles face a high risk of being caught in fishing nets, measures of protection should be implemented along this corridor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

How tree size and fecundity affect this process at the population level remains largely unknown because of insufficient replication across adults. We measured seed dispersal by the endangered neotropical timber species big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King, Meliaceae) in the Brazilian Amazon at 25 relatively isolated trees using multiple 1-m wide belt transects extended 100 m downwind. Tree diameter and fecundity correlated positively with increased seed shadow extent; but in combination large, high fecundity trees contributed disproportionately to longer-distance dispersal events (> 60 m). Among three empirical models fitted to seed density vs. distance in one dimension, the Student-t (2Dt) generally fit best (compared to the negative exponential and inverse power). When seedfall downwind was modelled in two dimensions using a normalised sample, it peaked furthest downwind (c. 25 m) for large, high-fecundity trees; with the inverse Gaussian and Weibull functions providing comparable fits that were slightly better than the lognormal. Although most seeds fell within 30 m of parent trees, relatively few juveniles were found within this distance, resulting in juvenile-to-seed ratios peaking at c. 35-45 m. Using the 2Dt model fits to predict seed densities downwind, coupled with known fecundity data for 2000-2009, we evaluated potential Swietenia regeneration near adults (<= 30 m dispersal) and beyond 30 m. Mean seed arrival into canopy gaps > 30 m downwind was more than 3x greater for large, high fecundity trees than small, high-fecundity trees. Tree seed production did not necessarily scale up proportionately with diameter, and was not consistent across years, and this resulting intraspecific variation can have important consequences for local patterns of dispersal in forests. Our results have important implications for management and conservation of big-leaf mahogany populations, and may apply to other threatened wind-dispersed Meliaceae trees.","[Norghauer, Julian M.] Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Nock, Charles A.] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Grogan, James] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",,"Norghauer, JM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Toronto, ON, Canada.",julian.norghauer@ips.unibe.ch,,,,,,,14,14,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 7,2011.0,6,3,,,,,,e17488,10.1371/journal.pone.0017488,,,,,,,,WOS:000288099800019,

Carbon fluxes were calculated using a book-keeping model. We ran 1000 simulations for a 105-year period with different combinations of values of carbon stocks (Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon in the top 0.2 m, and annual deforestation series. The 1000 combinations of parameters were performed as a sensitivity analysis that for each run, randomly selected the values of each variable within a predefined range of values and probability distributions. Using the simulation outputs, we calculated the accumulated C emissions due to deforestation from 1900 to 2005 and the annual emission as the average of the 1000 simulations, and uncertainties of our estimates as the standard deviation. We found that northern Argentine forests contain an estimated 4.54 Pg C (2.312 Pg C in biomass and 2.233 Pg C in soil). Between 1900 and 2005 approximately 30% of the forests were deforested, yielding carbon emissions of 0.945 (SD = 0.270) Pg C. Estimated average annual carbon emissions between 1996 and 2005, mostly from deforestation of the Chaco dry forests, were 20,875 (SD = 6,156) Gg C y(-1) (1 Gg = 10(-6) Pg). These values represent the largest source of carbon from land-cover change in the extra-tropical southern hemisphere, between 0.9 and 2.7% of the global carbon emissions from deforestation, and approximately 10% of carbon emissions from the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation, which has accelerated during the last decades as a result of modern agriculture expansion, represents a major national source of greenhouse gases and the second emission source, after fossil fuel consumption by fixed sources. We conclude that Argentine forests are an important carbon pool and emission source that need more attention for accurate global estimates, and seasonally dry forest deforestation is a key component of the Argentine carbon cycle.","[Gasparri, N.

Most sustainable forest management practices avoid clear-cuts and apply selective logging systems focused on a few commercial species. We applied a simulation model to estimate the impact of such selective logging scenarios on the genetic diversity and demography of four tropical tree species from French Guiana. The simulations used data on genetic and demographic composition, growth, phenology and pollen and seed dispersal obtained for Dicorynia guianensis, Sextonia rubra, Symphonia globulifera and Vouacapoua americana at the experimental site in Paracou. Whereas Symphonia globulifera serves as a model for a species with low logging pressure, the other three species represent the most exploited tree species in French Guiana. In simulations with moderate logging, typical for French Guiana, with large cutting diameter (> 60 cm diameter) and long cutting cycles (65 years), the two species V. americana and Sextonia rubra were not able to recover their initial stock at the end of the rotation period, with a large decrease in the number of individuals and in basal area. Under a more intensive logging system (cutting diameter > 45 cm diameter, cutting cycles of 30 years) that is common practice in the Brazilian Amazon, only Symphonia globulifera showed no negative impact. Generally, the differences between the genetic parameters in the control scenarios without logging and the logging scenarios were surprisingly small. The main reasons for this were the overlapping of generations and the effective dispersal ability of gene vectors in all species, which guarantee relative homogeneity of the genetic structure in different age classes. Nevertheless, decreasing the population size by logging reduced the number of genotypes and caused higher genetic distances between the original population and the population at the end of the logging cycles. Sensitivity analysis showed that genetic changes in the logging scenarios were principally determined by the growth, densities and cutting diameter of each species, and only to a very small extent by the reproductive system including factors such as pollen and seed dispersal and flowering phenology.

Frog-catching spiders have been documented from all continents except for Antarctica (.80% of the incidents occurring in the warmer areas between latitude 308 N and 308 S). Frog predation by spiders has been most frequently documented in the Neotropics, with particular concentration in the Central American and Amazon rain forests and the Brazilian Atlantic forest. The captured frogs are predominantly small-sized with an average body length of 2.76 6 0.13 cm (usually approximate to 0.2-3.8 g body mass). All stages of the frogs' life cycle (eggs/embryos, hatchlings, tadpoles, emerging metamorphs, immature post-metamorphs, adults) are vulnerable to spider predation. The majority (85%) of the 374 reported incidents of frog predation were attributable to web-less hunting spiders (in particular from the superfamilies Ctenoidea and Lycosoidea) which kill frogs by injection of powerful neurotoxins. The frog-catching spiders are predominantly nocturnal with an average body length of 2.24 +/- 0.12 cm (usually approximate to 0.1-2.7 g body mass). Altogether.200 frog species from 32 families (including several species of bitter tasting dart-poison frogs) have been documented to be hunted by >100 spider species from 22 families. Our finding that such a high diversity of spider taxa is utilizing such a high variety of frog taxa as prey is novel. The utilization of frogs as supplementary food increases the spiders' food supply (i.e., large diet breadth), and this is presumed to enhance their chance of survival. Studies from Australia and South America indicate that frogs might be a substantial component in the diet of some mygalomorph spiders (i.e., families Atracidae, Idiopidae, and Theraphosidae). Many more quantitative investigations on the natural diets of tropical spiders are needed before reliable conclusions on the importance of frogs as spider food can be drawn.","[Nyffeler, Martin] Univ Basel, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Altig, Ronald] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",,"Nyffeler, M (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",martin.nyffeler@unibas.ch,,,,,,,8,11,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2020.0,48,1,,,,26,42,,10.1636/0161-8202-48.1.26,,,,,,,,WOS:000543785600002,

Evidence from satellite data and health surveys,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Deforestation can increase malaria risk factors such as mosquito growth rates and biting rates in some settings. But deforestation affects more than mosquitoes-it is associated with socio-economic changes that affect malaria rates in humans. Most previous studies have found that deforestation is associated with increased malaria prevalence, suggesting that in some cases forest conservation might belong in a portfolio of anti-malarial interventions. However, previous peer-reviewed studies of deforestation and malaria were based on a small number of geographically aggregated observations, mostly from the Brazilian Amazon. Here we combine 14 years of high-resolution satellite data on forest loss with individual-level and nationally representative malaria tests for more than 60,000 rural children in 17 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 88% of malaria cases occur. Adhering to methods that we prespecified in a pre-analysis plan, we used multiple regression analysis to test ex-ante hypotheses derived from previous literature. Aggregated across countries, we did not find either deforestation or intermediate levels of forest cover to be associated with higher malaria prevalence. In nearly all (n = 78/84) country-year-specific regressions, we also did not find deforestation or intermediate levels of forest cover to be associated with higher malaria prevalence. However, we can not rule out associations at the local scale or beyond the geographic scope of our study region. We speculate that our findings may differ from those of previous studies because deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa is largely driven by the steady expansion of smallholder agriculture for domestic use by long-time residents in stable socio-economic settings where malaria is already endemic and previous exposure is high, while in much of Latin America and Asia deforestation is driven by rapid clearing for market-driven agricultural exports by new frontier migrants without previous exposure. These differences across regions suggest useful hypotheses to test in future research. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Yet, rapidly growing populations are driving continued degradation of tropical forests to supply wood products. The United Nations (UN) has developed the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programme to mitigate climate impacts and biodiversity losses through improved forest management. Consistent and reliable systems are still needed to monitor tropical forests at large scales, however, degradation has largely been left out of most REDD+ reporting given the lack of effective monitoring and countries mainly focus on deforestation. Recent advances in combining optical data and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have shown promise for improved ability to monitor forest losses, but it remains unclear if similar improvements could be made in detecting and mapping forest degradation. We used detailed selective logging records from three lowland tropical forest regions in the Brazilian Amazon to test the effectiveness of combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 for selective logging detection. We built Random Forest models to classify pixel-based differences in logged and unlogged regions to understand if combining optical and SAR improved the detection capabilities over optical data alone. We found that the classification accuracy of models utilizing optical data from Landsat 8 alone were slightly higher than models that combined Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8. In general, detection of selective logging was high with both optical only and optical-SAR combined models, but our results show that the optical data was dominating the predictive performance and adding SAR data introduced noise, lowering the detection of selective logging. While we have shown limited capabilities with C-band SAR, the anticipated opening of the ALOS-PALSAR archives and the anticipated launch of NISAR and BIOMASS in 2023 should stimulate research investigating similar methods to understand if longer wavelength SAR might improve classification of areas affected by selective logging when combined with optical data.","[Hethcoat, Matthew G.; Carreiras, Joao M.

The goal of the current article is to describe and analyze the therapeutic process of four cases from IDEAA, a center located in the Brazilian Amazon forest, dedicated to the treatment of addicts taken from Spain. An interdisciplinary perspective is proposed, combining cognitive and cultural insights from different fields (medical anthropology, cognitive science of religion, psychoneuroimmunology, qualitative sociology, cultural psychology). Ritual of ayahuasca will be considered as a way of producing a variety of experiences, and the memories of these experiences as ways of producing new biographic narratives. Biographic narratives are considered as a higher mental competence that includes functions related to self-knowledge, episodic memory, reflexivity, and psychosocial homeostasis. Under the appropriate set & setting, this process of narrative reconstruction helps the individual to cope with difficult situations, including addictions. The procedure used in this research consisted in a qualitative biographic methodology. The four cases described were treated in the period between 2000 and 2007. They started as poly drug users in the 1980s, at the end of the dictatorship period, when heroin made its entrance to Spain. The results describe the process of intervention used in the center, and the biographic narratives of each case. Most common types of experiences are mentioned: biographical revisions, psychological insights, emotional and transcendental experiences. Specific therapeutic mechanisms are also described. In the first case, a psychosomatic style of expression, where the subject describes strong embodied experiences of suffering his illnesses, and embodied expressions of coping with them. In the second case, a therapeutic process that includes the recognition of the former biographic narrative as a lie, and a symbolic way of producing new narratives of the self that spins around the presence of the jaguar. This animal acted as symbolic figure that triggered different meanings, useful for the recovery of the patient. The third case is a subject who was involved in drug traffic, robberies, and violent activities. Experiences related to social cognition (e.g. empathy, shame, self-forgiveness) played a major role in his therapeutic process. Last, the narrative of a woman addicted to heroin is analyzed. Biographical remembrances and self-forgiveness played an important role, but also her symbolic experiences with the proximity of death, related to her medical conditions (addiction to heroin, hepatitis C, HIV). The case is also a good example of how the treatment had a positive psychoneuroimmunology impact in the HIV viral load of the patient. As we will analyze, the effect cannot be explained by ayahuasca itself (in fact, the scientific literature suggest a negative or neutral impact), but by the therapeutic strategy as a whole, with its various components. The article concludes addressing the importance of the memory of the experience of the ritual as catalyzer of new meanings in the biographic narratives of the patients. The new narratives can be considered as system for self-regulation in the different, psychological, social, and cultural levels. Besides, it can also triggers different top-down psychoneuroimmunology and psychosomatic effects. The production of new narratives is related to what is usually called integration, and involves different psychological, social and cultural elements that are of great importance for a positive or negative therapeutic outcome.","[Apud, Ismael] Univ Republica, Fac Psicol, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Apud, Ismael] ANII, SNI, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Apud, Ismael] URV, MARC, Campus Catalunya, Catalunya, Spain",,"Apud, I (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Fac Psicol, Montevideo, Uruguay.; Apud, I (corresponding author), ANII, SNI, Montevideo, Uruguay.; Apud, I (corresponding author), URV, MARC, Campus Catalunya, Catalunya, Spain.",ismaelapud@psico.edu.uy,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JAN-JUN,2019.0,36,1,,,,133,154,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000510772700010,

Here we test for the effects of two isolation factors that may reduce population dispersal within river networks as potential drivers of freshwater fish speciation: 1) the position of subdrainages along the longitudinal river gradient, and 2) the level of fragmentation within subdrainages caused by natural waterfalls. The occurrence of native freshwater fish species from 26 subdrainages of the Orinoco drainage basin (South America) was used to identify those species that presumably arose from in-situ cladogenetic speciation (i.e. neo-endemic species; two or more endemic species from the same genus) within each subdrainage. We related subdrainages fish diversity (i.e. total, endemic and neo-endemic species richness) and an index of speciation to our two isolation factors while controlling for subdrainages size and energy availability. The longitudinal position of subdrainages was unrelated to any of our diversity measures, a result potentially explained by the spatial grain we used and/or the contemporary connection between Orinoco and Amazon basins via the upstream Casiquiare region. However, we found higher neo-endemic species richness and higher speciation index values in highly fragmented subdrainages. These results suggest that habitat fragmentation generated by natural waterfalls drives cladogenetic speciation in fragmented subdrainages. More generally, our results emphasize the role of history and natural waterfalls as biogeographic barriers promoting freshwater biodiversity in river drainage basins.","[Dias, Murilo S.; Cornu, Jean-Francois; Oberdorff, Thierry; Tedesco, Pablo A.] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS IRD UPMC MNHN, UMR BOREA, DMPA, FR-75231 Paris, France; [Lasso, Carlos A.] Inst Invest Recursos Biol Alexander von Humboldt, Programa Biol Conservac & Uso Biodiversidad, Bogota, Colombia",,"Dias, MS (corresponding author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS IRD UPMC MNHN, UMR BOREA, DMPA, 43 Rue Cuvier, FR-75231 Paris, France.",murilosd@hotmail.com,,,,,,,46,51,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2013.0,36,6,,,,683,689,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07724.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000319290600006,

We examine the extent of vulnerability of small and large farmers to these events in a tropical rainforest environment. Little attention has been given to the impact of ENSO events in Amazonia, despite evidence for devastating fires during ENSOs. Although we found a range of locally developed forecasting techniques and coping mechanisms, farmers have sustained significant losses, and we suggest that increased access to scientific forecasts would greatly enhance the ability of the farmers in our study area to cope with El Nino related weather events. In Amazonia the El Nino phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern leads to an extended period of reduced rainfall (Hobbs et al., 1998). This period of reduced rainfall can result in significant agricultural losses for farmers and ranchers in the area and in increased forest flammability. We have found that the majority of our study population uses several methods of forecasting, coping with, and adapting to drought events - and they recognize the economic losses they can experience and the loss of forests through the accidental spread of fire. The poorest farmers in our study area experience El Nino related drought events as a serious threat to their livelihoods. Their vulnerability is heightened during extreme climate events and our observations revealed that all of the farmers in our study would benefit from increased availability of improved forecast information relevant to their locality and their current farming strategies. This paper examines the availability and use of forecasts, the occurrence of accidental fires and techniques to prevent fire related losses, and the coping mechanisms for dealing with El Nino related drought in the agricultural regions surrounding the cities of Altamira and Santarem, in Para State, Brazil. Distribution of an El Nino Prediction Kit at the end of the study and a series of workshops may lead to better local information on rainfall variability and create a farmer-maintained grid of collecting stations to sensitize farmers to the variability of precipitation in the region, and on their property.","Indiana Univ, Anthropol Ctr Training Global Environm Change, ACT, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Indiana Univ, Ctr Study Populat Inst & Environm Change, CIPEC, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Anthropol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",,"Moran, EF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Anthropol Ctr Training Global Environm Change, ACT, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",moran@indiana.edu,,,,,,,30,31,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2006.0,77,3-4,,,,343,361,,10.1007/s10584-005-9035-9,,,,,,,,WOS:000240307600011,

Reduction of genetic redundancies is an essential step to improve the accuracy and efficiency of genebank management. The present study targeted the assessment of genetic redundancy and genetic structure in an international cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) collection maintained in Costa Rica. A total of 688 cacao accessions maintained in this collection were genotyped with 15 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci, using a capillary electrophoresis genotyping system. The SSR markers provided a high resolution among the accessions. Thirty-six synonymously labeled sets, involving 135 accessions were identified based on the matching of multilocus SSR profiles. After the elimination of synonymous sets, the level of redundancy caused by closely related accessions in the collection was assessed using a simulated sampling scheme that compared allelic diversity in different sample sizes. The result of the simulation suggested that a random sample of 113 accessions could capture 90% of the total allelic diversity in this collection. Principal Coordinate Analysis revealed that the Trinitario hybrids from Costa Rica shared a high similarity among groups as well as among individual accessions. The analysis of the genetic structure illustrated that the within-country/within-region difference accounted for 84.6% of the total molecular variation whereas the among-country/among-region difference accounted for 15.4%. The Brazilian germplasm contributed most to this collection in terms of total alleles and private alleles. The intercountry/interregion relationship by cluster analysis largely agreed with the geographical origin of each germplasm group and supported the hypothesis that the Upper Amazon region is the center of diversity for cacao. The results of the present study indicated that the CATIE International Cacao Collection contains a high level of genetic redundancy. It should be possible to rationalize this collection by reducing redundancy and ensuring optimal representation of the genetic diversity from distinct germplasm groups. The results also demonstrated that SSR markers, together with the statistical tools for individual identification and redundancy assessment, are technically practical and sufficiently informative to assist the management of a tropical plant germplasm collection.","[Zhang, Dapeng; Mischke, Sue; Johnson, Elizabeth S.; Meinhardt, Lyndel] USDA ARS, Beltsville Agr Res Ctr, Sustainable Perennial Crops Lab, Inst Plant Sci, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Phillips-Mora, Wilbert] Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Lab Biotecnol, Turrialba, Costa Rica",,"Zhang, DP (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Beltsville Agr Res Ctr, Sustainable Perennial Crops Lab, Inst Plant Sci, Bldg 1, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.",ZhangD@ba.ars.usda.gov,,,,,,,36,40,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2009.0,5,1,,,,1,10,,10.1007/s11295-008-0163-z,,,,,,,,WOS:000261265100001,

The system achieves maximum precipitation over the southern Amazon basin and the Brazilian highlands during the austral summer. Monsoon changes are associated with the large-scale dynamics, but during its early stages, when the surface is not sufficiently wet, soil moisture anomalies may also modulate the development of precipitation. To investigate this, sensitivity experiments to initial soil moisture conditions were performed using month-long simulations with the regional mesoscale Eta model. Examination of the control simulations shows that they reproduce all major features and magnitudes of the South American circulation and precipitation patterns, particularly those of the monsoon. The surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, as well as precipitation, have a diurnal cycle whose phase is consistent with previous observational studies. The convective inhibition is smallest at the time of the precipitation maximum, but the convective available potential energy exhibits an unrealistic morning maximum that may result from an early boundary layer mixing. The sensitivity experiments show that precipitation is more responsive to reductions of soil moisture than to increases, suggesting that although the soil is not too wet, it is sufficiently humid to easily reach levels where soil moisture anomalies stop being effective in altering the evapotranspiration and other surface and boundary layer variables. Two mechanisms by which soil moisture has a positive feedback with precipitation are discussed. First, the reduction of initial soil moisture leads to a smaller latent heat flux and a larger sensible heat flux, and both contribute to a larger Bowen ratio. The smaller evapotranspiration and increased sensible heat flux lead to a drier and warmer boundary layer, which in turn reduces the atmospheric instability. Second, the deeper (and drier) boundary layer is related to a stronger and higher South American low-level jet (SALLJ). However, because of the lesser moisture content, the SALLJ carries less moisture to the monsoon region, as evidenced by the reduced moisture fluxes and their convergence. The two mechanisms-reduced convective instability and reduced moisture flux convergence-act concurrently to diminish the core monsoon precipitation.","[Collini, Estela A.] Argentine Navy Weather Serv Argentine Hydrog Serv, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Berbery, Ernesto H.] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Barros, Vicente R.] Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pyle, Matthew E.] Natl Ctr Environm Predict, Camp Springs, MD USA",,"Collini, EA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, ESSIC, 3427 Comp & Space Bldg,Coll Pk, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",berbery@atmos.umd.edu,,,,,,,48,48,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 15,2008.0,21,2,,,,195,213,,10.1175/2007JCLI1846.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000252704600003,

The richest diversity of freshwater fishes in the world is found in the Amazon Basin, a system where marked hydrochemical differences exist at the interface of major rivers with distinct water colors (i.e., black, white, and clear water). We hypothesize that divergent natural selection associated with these aquatic ecotones influences population-level adaptive divergence in the non-migratory Amazonian fish fauna. This hypothesis was tested using a landscape genomics framework to compare the relative contribution of environmental and spatial factors to the evolutionary divergence of the Amazonian characin fish Triportheus albus. The framework was based on spatial data, in situ hydrochemical measurements, and 15,251 filtered SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) for T. albus sampled from three major Amazonian rivers. Gradient Forest, redundancy analysis (RDA) and BayPass analyses were used to test for signals of natural selection, and model-based and model-free approaches were used to evaluate neutral population differentiation. After controlling for a signal of neutral hierarchical structure which was consistent with the expectations for a dendritic system, variation in turbidity and pH were key factors contributing to adaptive divergence. Variation in genes involved in acid-sensitive ion transport pathways and light-sensitive photoreceptor pathways was strongly associated with pH and turbidity variability. This study improves our understanding of how natural selection and neutral evolution impact on the distribution of aquatic biodiversity from the understudied and ecologically complex Amazonia.","[Hay, Abbie C.; Sandoval-Castillo, Jonathan; Beheregaray, Luciano B.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Mol Ecol Lab, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Cooke, Georgina M.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mol Ecol Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Chao, Ning L.] Bioamazonia Conservat Int, Brookline, MA USA; [Chao, Ning L.] Natl Museum Marine Biol & Aquarium, Pingtung, Taiwan",,"Beheregaray, LB (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Mol Ecol Lab, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",luciano.beheregaray@flinders.edu.au,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 4,2022.0,10,,,,,,,825406,10.3389/fevo.2022.825406,,,,,,,,WOS:000773474800001,

Differing cloud types (both precipitating and nonprecipitating) play an important role in determining the total diabatic heating profile. Variations in the vertical structure of the apparent heat source, Q(1) can be related to the diurnal cycle, large-scale forcings such as atmospheric waves, and rain thresholds at each location. For example, TRMM-LBA, which occurred in the Brazilian Amazon, had mostly deep convection during the day while KWAJEX, which occurred in the western portion of the Pacific intertropical convergence zone, had more shallow and moderately deep daytime convection. Therefore, the afternoon height of maximum heating was more bottom heavy (i.e., heating below 600 hPa) during KWAJEX compared to TRMM-LBA. More organized convective systems with extensive stratiform rain areas and upper-level cloud decks tended to occur in the early and late morning hours during TRMM-LBA and KWAJEX, respectively, thereby causing Q(1) profiles to be top heavy (i.e., maxima from 600 to 400 hPa) at those times. SCSMEX, which occurred in the South China Sea during the monsoon season, had top-heavy daytime and nighttime heating profiles suggesting that mesoscale convective systems occurred throughout the diurnal cycle, although more precipitation and upper-level cloud in the afternoon caused the daytime heating maximum to be larger. A tendency toward bottom- and top-heavy heating profile variations is also associated with the different cloud types that occurred before and after the passage of easterly wave troughs during KWAJEX, the easterly and westerly regimes during TRMM-LBA, and the monsoon onset and postonset active periods during SCSMEX. Rain thresholds based on heavy, moderate, and light/no-rain amounts can further differentiate top-heavy heating, bottom-heavy heating, and tropospheric cooling. These budget studies suggest that model calculations and satellite retrievals of Q(1) must account for a large number of factors in order to accurately determine the vertical structure of diabatic heating associated with tropical cloud systems.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; SUNY Stony Brook, Marine Sci Res Ctr, Inst Terr & Planetary Atmospheres, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,"Schumacher, C (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, 3150 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",courtney@ariel.met.tamu.edu,,,,,,,65,65,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2007.0,64,7,,,,2593,2610,,10.1175/JAS3938.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000248335400023,

Methodology/Principles findings To identify the bioecological drivers of RABV circulation in neotropical bat communities, we conducted a molecular and serological survey on almost 1,000 bats from 30 species, and a 4-year longitudinal survey in two colonies of vampire bats in French Guiana. RABV was molecularly detected in a common vampire and in a frugivorous bat. The sequences corresponded to haematophagous bat-related strains and were close to viruses circulating in the Brazilian Amazon region. Species' seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 20%, and the risk of seropositivity was higher in bats with a haematophagous diet, living in monospecific colonies and in dense forests. The longitudinal survey showed substantial temporal fluctuations, with individual waves of seroconversions and waning immunity. The high prevalences observed in bat communities, in most habitats and in species that do not share the same microhabitats and bioecological patterns, the temporal variations, and a rather short period of detectable antibodies as observed in recaptured vampires suggest (i) frequent exposure of animals, (ii) an ability of the infected host to control and eliminate the virus, (iii) more relaxed modes of exposure between bats than the commonly assumed infection via direct contact with saliva of infected animals, all of which should be further investigated. Conclusions/significance We hypothesize that RABV circulation in French Guiana is mainly maintained in the pristine forest habitats that may provide sufficient food resources to allow vampire bats, the main prevalent species, to survive and RABV to be propagated. However, on the forest edge andin disturbed areas, human activities may induce more insidious effects such as defaunation. One of the ecological consequences is the disappearance of resources for tertiary or secondary consumers. Populations of vampires may then shift to alternative resources such as cattle, domestic animals and humans. Therefore, a good forest status, allowing both a dilution effect in highly rich bat communities and the maintenance of large populations of medium-sized and large mammals used as prey by vampires, should prevent their migration to anthropized areas.","[de Thoisy, Benoit; Darcissac, Edith; Donato, Damien; Guidez, Amandine; Salmier, Arielle; Lacoste, Vincent; Lavergne, Anne] Inst Pasteur, Lab Interact Virus Hotes, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Bourhy, Herve; Dacheux, Laurent; Larrous, Florence; Lavenir, Rachel] Inst Pasteur, Natl Reference Ctr Rabies, Lyssavirus Dynam & Host Adaptat Unit, Paris, France; [Delaval, Marguerite] Off Natl Forets, Sylvetude, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Pontier, Dominique] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",,"de Thoisy, B (corresponding author), Inst Pasteur, Lab Interact Virus Hotes, Cayenne, French Guiana.",bdethoisy@pasteur-cayenne.fr,,,,,,,27,29,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2016.0,10,1,,,,,,e0004378,10.1371/journal.pntd.0004378,,,,,,,,WOS:000372565700071,

Sampling may reduce the cost of monitoring but is also a source of error in estimates of areas and rates. A common sampling approach is systematic sampling, in which sample units of a constant size are distributed in some regular manner, such as a grid. The proposed approach for the 2010 Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a systematic sample of 10 km wide squares at every 1 degrees intersection of latitude and longitude. We assessed the outcome of this and other systematic samples for estimating deforestation at national, sub-national and continental levels. The study is based on digital data on deforestation patterns for the five Amazonian countries outside Brazil plus the Brazilian Amazon. We tested these schemes by varying sample-unit size and frequency. We calculated two estimates of sampling error. First we calculated the standard errors, based on the size, variance and covariance of the samples, and from this calculated the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Second, we calculated the actual errors, based on the difference between the sample-based estimates and the estimates from the full-coverage maps. At the continental level, the 1 degrees ,10 km scheme had a CI of 21% and an actual error of 8%. At the national level, this scheme had CIs of 126% for Ecuador and up to 67% for other countries. At this level, increasing sampling density to every 0.25 degrees produced a CI of 32% for Ecuador and CIs of up to 25% for other countries, with only Brazil having a CI of less than 10%. Actual errors were within the limits of the CIs in all but two of the 56 cases. Actual errors were half or less of the CIs in all but eight of these cases. These results indicate that the FRA 2010 should have CIs of smaller than or close to 10% at the continental level. However, systematic sampling at the national level yields large CIs unless the sample size is very large, especially if any sub-national stratification of estimates is required.","[Steininger, M.

The set up of an artificial oxygenation system in the anoxic freshwater end-member generates sharp gradients of major chemical species (iron, sulfides, etc.) coupled with intense organic matter (OM) turnover. The coexistence of oxygenated waters and dissolved sulfides in an organic rich environment depicts the Upper Sinnamary Estuary (USE: part of Sinnamary Estuary under the tidal influence but upstream of the salt intrusion) as a potential site for Hg methylation. The concentrations of all mercury compounds (HgT) in the unfiltered samples (HgTUNF), in the dissolved (HgTD) and particulate (HgTP) phases of the USE average 11 +/- 3, 6 +/- 2 and 5 +/- 3 (i.e. 600 +/- 200 pmol g(-1)) pmol L-1, respectively. Average concentrations of monomethylmercury (MMHg) in the unfiltered (MMHgUNF), dissolved (MMHgD) and particulate (MMHgP) phases were 3.7 +/- 1.0, 2.0 +/- 0.9 and 1.8 +/- 1.2 (i.e. 220 +/- 130 pmol g(-1)) pmol L-1, respectively. Water oxygenation and sulfides concentrations emerged to play a critical role in controlling MMHg levels. Additionally, iron cycling, acid-base mechanisms, and redox-dependent processes were involved in the MMHg partitioning between phases. Overall, the USE constitutes a biogeochemical reactor that gathers partitioning and methylation processes. The permanent MMHg inputs from the anoxic freshwater end-member combined with the intense endogenous Hg methylation ensures high-MMHg levels in both dissolved and particulate phases. To illustrate, the USE exports 60 +/- 20% more MMHgUNF than it imports: 5.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.2 kg year(-1). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking advantage of the recent growth in broadband data sampling, we compute the model using waveform fits of over 1.2 million vertical-component seismograms, obtained with the automated multimode inversion of surface, S and multiple S waves. Each waveform provides a set of linear equations constraining perturbations with respect to a 3-D reference model within an approximate sensitivity volume. We then combine all equations into a large linear system and solve it for a 3-D model of Sand P-wave speeds and azimuthal anisotropy within the crust, upper mantle and uppermost lower mantle. In South America and Africa, our new model SA2019 reveals detailed structure of the lithosphere, with structure of the cratons within the continents much more complex than seen previously. In South America, lower seismic velocities underneath the transbrasilian lineament (TBL) separate the high-velocity anomalies beneath the Amazon Craton from those beneath the Sao Francisco and Parana Cratons. We image the buried portions of the Amazon Craton, the thick cratonic lithosphere of the Parana and Parnaiba Basins and an apparently cratonic block wedged between western Guyana and the slab to the west of it, unexposed at the surface. Thick cratonic lithosphere is absent under the Archean crust of the Sao Luis, Luis Alves and Rio de La Plata Cratons, next to the continental margin. The Guyana Highlands are underlain by low velocities, indicating hot asthenosphere. In the transition zone, we map the subduction of the Nazca Plate and the Chile Rise under Patagonia. Cratonic lithosphere beneath Africa is more fragmented than seen previously, with separate cratonic units observed within the West African and Congo Cratons, and with cratonic lithosphere absent beneath large portions of Archean crust. We image the lateral extent of the Niassa Craton, hypothesized previously and identify a new unit, the Cubango Craton, near the southeast boundary of the grater Congo Craton, with both of these smaller cratons unexposed at the surface. In the South Atlantic, the model reveals the patterns of interaction between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and the nearby hotspots. Low-velocity anomalies beneath major hotspots extend substantially deeper than those beneath the MAR. The Vema Hotspot, in particular, displays a pronounced low-velocity anomaly under the thick, high-velocity lithosphere o f the Cape Basin. A strong low velocity anomaly also underlies the Cameroon Volcanic Line and its offshore extension, between Africa and the MAR. Subtracting the global, age-dependent Vs averages from those in the South Atlantic Basins, we observe areas where the cooling lithosphere is locally hotter than average, corresponding to the location of the Tristan da Cunha, Vema and Trindade hotspots. Beneath the anomalously deep Argentine Basin, we image unusually thick, high-velocity lithosphere, which suggests that its anomalously great depth can be explained, at least to a large extent, by isostatic, negative lithospheric buoyancy.","[Celli, N.

Some authors have proposed the existence of two species, several subspecies, and different Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) in the Hydrochoerus genus. However, the available genetic studies of capybaras are limited in their geographical scope. Thus, we examined genetic variation in 387 sequences of the mitochondrial control region (124 generated by the authors and 263 obtained from GenBank) and performed phylogeographic analyses to determine patterns of geographic variation in capybaras sampled in seven South American countries, representing a large portion of the distribution range of the species. Based on these analyses, four ESUs were identified. In addition, within one of these units, two distant geographic populations were identified in the Trans-Andean Colombia (putative H. isthmius population) and the cis-Andean area of the Napo River in Peru and Ecuador. This result and the genetic distances between these ESUs agree with the idea of a unique capybara species. Mismatch distributions and Bayesian skyline plots suggested that capybaras have undergone processes of population decline associated with the adverse weather conditions of the late Pleistocene, followed by population expansions associated with the climatic conditions of the Holocene Climatic Optimum. Phylogenetic trees support the previous hypothesis that the species originated in Western Amazon. However, as our results are based on a single mitochondrial fragment, these results are not conclusive. New studies, including samples from other sites and more mitochondrial and nuclear markers, may elucidate the evolutionarily history of capybaras.","[Soledad Byrne, Maria; Ignacio Tunez, Juan] Univ Nacl Lujan, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Grp Invest Ecol Mol GIEM, Ruta 5 & Ave Constituc S-N, RA-6700 Lujan, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Ruiz-Garcia, Manuel] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Biol, Lab Genet Poblac Mol Biol Evolut, Cra 7A 43-82, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Ignacio Tunez, Juan] Univ Nacl Lujan, Inst Ecol & Desarrollo Sustentable INEDES UNLu CO, Ruta 5 & Ave Constituc S-N, RA-6700 Lujan, Buenos Aires, Argentina",,"Byrne, MS (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Lujan, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Grp Invest Ecol Mol GIEM, Ruta 5 & Ave Constituc S-N, RA-6700 Lujan, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",solebyrne@gmail.com,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022.0,29,1,,,,191,206,,10.1007/s10914-021-09569-2,,OCT 2021,,,,,,WOS:000707545000001,

However, creating a DSU system to allow programs written in the C programming language to be modified while they are executing is challenging. This paper presents the Portable Software Update (PSU) system, a new framework that allows the creation of C-language DSU programs. PSU offers a simple programming interface to build DSU versions of existing C programs. Once a program is built using PSU, updates can be applied by background threads that have negligible impact on the execution of the program. PSU supports multi-threaded and recursive programs without the use of safe points or thread blocking. PSU uses function indirection to redirect DSU functions calls to the newest version of the function code. Once a DSU function is invoked in a PSU program, it executes to completion using the version of the function that was active when it was invoked. However, if a new version is installed, any future calls to the same function always execute the newest version. This simple mechanism allows for quick loading of updates in PSU. PSU unloads obsolete version of DSU functions after they are no longer executing. This mechanism makes PSU the first DSU system for C-language programs that is able to unload older versions of code. This efficient use of resources enables many patches to be applied to a long-running application. A suite of specialized custom synthetic programs, and a DSUenabled version of the MySQL database storage engine, are used to evaluate the overhead of the DSU-enabling features. The MySQL storage engine maintains over 95% of the performance of the non-DSU version and allows the entire storage engine to be updated while the database continues executing. PSU includes a simple and straightforward process for the modification of the storage engine that enables DSU.","[Karpoff, Marcus] Amazon, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Amaral, Jose Nelson] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Wang, Kai-Ting Amy; Ho, Rayson] Huawei Canada Res Ctr, Markham, ON, Canada; [Dobry, Brice] Futurewei Technol, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Karpoff, M (corresponding author), Amazon, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",mkarpoff@amazon.com; jamaral@ualberta.ca; kai.ting.wang@huawei.com; Rayson.Ho@huawei.com; brice.dobry@futurewei.com,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,,,,,,233,240,,10.1109/SBAC-PAD49847.2020.00040,,,,,,,,WOS:000630462100029,

Results of this research indicated that increase in impervious surface area mainly resulted from the loss of cerrado in the initial decade of the study period and from loss of agricultural lands in the last two decades. Increase in agropasture was mainly at the expense of losing cerrado in the first two decades and relatively evenly from the loss of primary forest and cerrado in the last decade. When impervious surface area was less than approximately 40 km(2) before 1999, impervious surface area was negatively related to cerrado and forest, and positively related to agropasture areas, but after impervious surface area reached 40 km(2) in 1999, no obvious relationship exists between them.","[Lu, Dengsheng; Hetrick, Scott; Moran, Emilio; Li, Guiying] Indiana Univ, Anthropol Ctr Training & Res Global Environm Chan, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",,"Lu, DS (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Anthropol Ctr Training & Res Global Environm Chan, Student Bldg 331,701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",dlu@indiana.edu,,,,,,,23,23,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2012.0,78,7,,,,747,755,,10.14358/PERS.78.7.747,,,,,,,,WOS:000306047600011,

The relationship between the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and interannual variations in monsoon strength, however, has received little attention so far. Here we investigate how variations in the intensity of the SASM influence delta O-18 in precipitation based on both observational data and Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) simulations. An index of vertical wind shear over the SASM entrance ( low level) and exit ( upper level) region over the western equatorial Atlantic is used to de. ne interannual variations in summer monsoon strength. This index is closely correlated with variations in deep convection over tropical and subtropical South America during the mature stage of the SASM. Observational data from the International Atomic Energy Agency-Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (IAEA-GNIP) and from tropical ice cores show a significant negative association between delta O-18 and SASM strength over the Amazon basin, SE South America and the central Andes. The more depleted stable isotopic values during intense monsoon seasons are consistent with the so-called amount effect, often observed in tropical regions. In many locations, however, our results indicate that the moisture transport history and the degree of rainout upstream may be more important factors explaining interannual variations in delta O-18. In many locations the stable isotopic composition is closely related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), even though the moisture source is located over the tropical Atlantic and precipitation is the result of the southward expansion and intensification of the SASM during austral summer. ENSO induces significant atmospheric circulation anomalies over tropical South America, which affect both SASM precipitation and delta O-18 variability. Therefore many regions show a weakened relationship between SASM and delta O-18, once the SASM signal is decomposed into its ENSO-, and non-ENSO- related variance.","Univ Massachusetts, Morrill Sci Ctr, Dept Geosci, Climate Syst Res Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany",,"Vuille, M (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Morrill Sci Ctr, Dept Geosci, Climate Syst Res Ctr, 611 N Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",mathias@geo.umass.edu,,,,,,,164,168,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2005.0,25,4,,,,401,413,,10.1007/s00382-005-0049-9,,,,,,,,WOS:000232374400005,

Although relevant inventory data are rapidly accumulating in the literature, real site-to-site diversity differences are hard to identify because many confounding factors can affect the size and composition of faunal lists. Herein we assess the available information about Neotropical rainforest mammal diversity and suggest guidelines for future work by reviewing inventory methods, documenting and discussing faunal lists from ten localities, and summarizing geographic range data to predict diversity patterns that can be tested by field and museum research. All inventory methods are biased because each is suitable for collecting or observing only a fraction of the morphologically and behaviorally diverse mammalian fauna that inhabits Neotropical rainforests. Hence, many methods must be used in combination to census whole communities. Although no combination of methods can be guaranteed to produce complete inventories, the omission or nonintensive application of any of several essential methods probably guarantees incomplete results. We recommend nine methods that, used intensively and in combination, should maximize the efficiency of future inventory fieldwork. Ten rainforest mammal inventories selected as exemplars illustrate several common problems: sampling effort is highly variable from study to study, species accumulation curves are not asymptotic for any fauna, essential field methods were omitted in every case, and some localities were partially defaunated by hunters prior to inventory. Meaningful diversity comparisons are therefore impossible without a major investment in additional fieldwork at each site. Geographic range data provide an essential alternative source of diversity estimates. Comparisons of inventory results with geographic expectations (diversity predictions based on range data) suggest that all existing inventories are incomplete, that the degree of incompleteness is inversely correlated with inventory duration, and that special methods are required to add elusive species to faunal lists. The range data at hand also suggest several geographic patterns that should be tested with carefully focussed fieldwork. (1) Mammalian diversity in Amazonia is probably greatest in the western subregion (between the Rio Negro and the Rio Madeira, where over 200 species might be sympatric at some localities), least in the Guiana subregion (east of the Negro and north of the Amazon), and intermediate in southeastern Amazonia (east of the Madeira and south of the Amazon). (2) Geographic variation in Amazonian diversity chiefly involves marsupials, bats, primates, and rodents; by contrast, xenarthran, carnivore, and ungulate faunas are remarkably uniform across the entire region. (3) In Central American rainforests, a conspicuous and apparently monotonic diversity gradient extends from eastern Panama (where mammalian diversity is within the range of Amazonian values) to southern Mexico (where mammalian diversity may be less than anywhere else on the rainforested Neotropical mainland). Mammalian diversity in coastal Venezuelan and southeastern Brazilian rainforests is difficult to assess with existing literature and collection resources, but neither region is likely to be as diverse as Amazonia. Despite a few dissenting voices, the literature of New World mammalogy provides compelling evidence that mammalian diversity, as measured by sympatric species richness, is greatest in lowland tropical rainforests and decreases along gradients of increasing latitude, elevation, and aridity. Thus, the mammalian faunas of western Amazonia are the most diverse of any in the Americas and perhaps in the world. We briefly discuss the generality and causes of observed diversity patterns in terms of contemporary ecology and historical scenarios. Significant advances in understanding mammalian diversity patterns in Neotropical rainforests will require systematic revisions of many problematic genera and an aggressive program to inventory poorly sampled areas while opportunities to do so yet remain.","SMITHSONIAN INST, DIV MAMMALS, WASHINGTON, DC 20560 USA",,"Voss, RS (corresponding author), AMER MUSEUM NAT HIST, DEPT MAMMAL, NEW YORK, NY 10024 USA.",,,,,,,,153,181,,,,,,,,,,,,1996.0,,230,,,,3,115,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VK49800001,

This research selected Lucas do Rio Verde County in Mato Grosso State, Brazil as a case study to improve impervious surface estimation performance by the integrated use of Landsat and QuickBird images and to monitor impervious surface change by analyzing the normalized multitemporal Landsat-derived fractional impervious surfaces. This research demonstrates the importance of two-step calibrations. The first step is to calibrate the Landsat-derived fraction impervious surface values through the established regression model based on the QuickBird-derived impervious surface image in 2008. The second step is to conduct the normalization between the calibrated 2008 impervious surface image with other dates of impervious surface images. This research indicates that the per-pixel based method overestimates the impervious surface area in the urban-rural frontier by 50%-60%. In order to accurately estimate impervious surface area, it is necessary to map the fractional impervious surface image and further calibrate the estimates with high spatial resolution images. Also normalization of the multitemporal fractional impervious surface images is needed to reduce the impacts from different environmental conditions, in order to effectively detect the impervious surface dynamic change in a complex urban-rural frontier. The procedure developed in this paper for mapping and monitoring impervious surface area is especially valuable in urban-rural frontiers where multitemporal Landsat images are difficult to be used for accurately extracting impervious surface features based on traditional per-pixel based classification methods as they cannot effectively handle the mixed pixel problem.

Though illegal logging has continued, frames about Brazil's forest policy and management have changed since that time. While until 2010 the successful implementation of forest policies and the resulting decline in deforestation rates were there for all to see and appreciate, the increase in the deforestation rate since then has become the focus of international criticism. With the help of a structured review of international scientific literature, newspaper articles, and programmes initiated by non-governmental organizations' (NGO) and international organizations' (10), this paper aims to analyse the frames of illegal logging and its governance responses in Brazil since 2012. The review is guided by the framework of diagnostic (What is the problem? Who is to blame?) and prognostic framing (proposed policy and governance solutions). The main findings revealed a master frame of environmental justice that combines injustice toward indigenous people with the victimization of forest and environment at large. Embedded in this master frame, specific frames that follow the institutional logic of the single policy discourses have been identified. Finally, the results show a strong national focus of governance with continued emphasis on command and control instruments.","[Kleinschmit, Daniela; Ferraz Ziegert, Rafaella; Walther, Laura] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Freiburg, Germany",,"Kleinschmit, D (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Freiburg, Germany.",daniela.kleinschmit@ifp.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 25,2021.0,4,,,,,,,624072,10.3389/ffgc.2021.624072,,,,,,,,WOS:000658687600001,

There are few systematic studies of the determinants of environmental preferences in emerging economies, and Brazil is a particularly interesting case because of its democratic political system, rapid economic growth, and importance for the global environment. In general, we find that the Brazilian public is highly supportive of environmental protection. To explain variation in environmental preferences, we focus on the effects of income and education. Many previous studies suggest that both should have positive effects, but the empirical evidence is mixed. Indeed, we find that income has no effect on environmental preferences. However, education is a strong predictor of environmental preferences. While college education is not necessary for environmental awareness, there is a large difference between Brazilians with primary and secondary education. For policy, the findings imply that investment in secondary education can raise environmental awareness, regardless of income levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To assess the response of Dipteryx to logging, we conducted inventories in three logging areas in the Regions of Ucayali and Loreto, Peru. The size-class distributions of Dipteryx populations in recently logged sites showed that initial post-logging conditions enhance recruitment of residual seedlings. These conditions are created by a combination of logging gaps and the activities of farmers migrating into logged lands. Through protection and liberation of shihuahuaco seedlings in post-logged forest as well as within and around agricultural fields, local residents and timber companies could favor the recovery of this valued resource.

This study investigates how terrestrial vegetation coverage and carbon fluxes change in a world stabilizing at 1.5 & DEG;C and 2 & DEG;C warmer than pre-industrial level. Model results derived from 20 Earth System Models (ESMs) under low, middle, and high greenhouse emission scenarios from CMIP5 and CMIP6 are employed to supply the projected results. Although the ESMs show a large spread of uncertainties, the ensemble means of global LAI are projected to increase by 0.04 & PLUSMN; 0.02 and 0.08 & PLUSMN; 0.04 in the 1.5 and 2.0 & DEG;C warming worlds, respectively. Vegetation density is projected to decrease only in the Brazilian Highlands due to the decrease of precipitation there. The high latitudes in Eurasia are projected to have stronger increase of LAI in the 2.0 & DEG;C warming world compared to that in 1.5 & DEG;C warming level caused by the increase of tree coverage. The largest zonal LAI is projected around 70 & DEG; N while the largest zonal NPP is projected around 60 & DEG; N and equator. The zonally inhomogeneous increase of vegetation density and productivity relates to the zonally inhomogeneous increase of temperature, which in turn could amplify the latitudinal gradient of temperature with additional warming. Most of the ESMs show uniform increases of global averaged NPP by 10.68 & PLUSMN; 8.60 and 15.42 & PLUSMN; 10.90 PgC year(-1) under 1.5 & DEG;C and 2.0 & DEG;C warming levels, respectively, except in some sparse vegetation areas. The ensemble averaged NEE is projected to increase by 3.80 & PLUSMN; 7.72 and 4.83 & PLUSMN; 10.13 PgC year(-1) in the two warming worlds. The terrestrial ecosystem over most of the world could be a stronger carbon sink than at present. However, some dry areas in Amazon and Central Africa may convert to carbon sources in a world with additional 0.5 & DEG;C warming. The start of the growing season in the northern high latitudes is projected to advance by less than one month earlier. Five out of 10 CMIP6 ESMs, which use the Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2) dataset or a prescribed potential vegetation distribution to constrain the future change of vegetation types, do not reduce the model uncertainties in projected LAI and terrestrial carbon fluxes. This may suggest the challenge in optimizing the carbon fluxes modeling in the future.","[Peng, Xiaobin; Yu, Miao; Chen, Haishan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Int Joint Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Minist Educ,Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Peng, Xiaobin; Yu, Miao; Chen, Haishan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China",,"Yu, M (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Int Joint Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Minist Educ,Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.; Yu, M (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",20191201062@nuist.edu.cn; yum@nuist.edu.cn; haishan@nuist.edu.cn,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022.0,13,1,,,,,,42,10.3390/atmos13010042,,,,,,,,WOS:000747920800001,

Due to black carbon's aromatic structure it is recalcitrant and has the potential for long-term carbon sequestration in soil. Soils within the Amazon-basin contain numerous sites where the 'dark earth of the Indians' (Terra preta de Indio, or Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE)) exist and are composed of variable quantities of highly stable organic black carbon waste ('biochar'). The apparent high agronomic fertility of these sites, relative to tropical soils in general, has attracted interest. Biochars can be produced by 'baking' organic matter under low oxygen ('pyrolysis'). The quantities of key mineral elements within these biochars can be directly related to the levels of these components in the feedstock prior to burning. Their incorporation in soils influences soil structure, texture, porosity, particle size distribution and density. The molecular structure of biochars shows a high degree of chemical and microbial stability. A key physical feature of most biochars is their highly porous structure and large surface area. This structure can provide refugia for beneficial soil micro-organisms such as mycorrhizae and bacteria, and influences the binding of important nutritive cations and anions. This binding can enhance the availability of macro-nutrients such as N and P. Other biochar soil changes include alkalisation of soil pH and increases in electrical conductivity (EC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Ammonium leaching has been shown to be reduced, along with N2O soil emissions. There may also be reductions in soil mechanical impedance. Terra preta soils contain a higher number of 'operational taxonomic units' and have highly distinctive microbial communities relative to neighbouring soils. The potential importance of biochar soil incorporation on mycorrhizal fungi has also been noted with biochar providing a physical niche devoid of fungal grazers. Improvements in soil field capacity have been recorded upon biochar additions. Evidence shows that bioavailability and plant uptake of key nutrients increases in response to biochar application, particularly when in the presence of added nutrients. Depending on the quantity of biochar added to soil significant improvements in plant productivity have been achieved, but these reports derive predominantly from studies in the tropics. As yet there is limited critical analysis of possible agricultural impacts of biochar application in temperate regions, nor on the likelihood of utilising such soils as long-term sites for carbon sequestration. This review aims to determine the extent to which inferences of experience mostly from tropical regions could be extrapolated to temperate soils and to suggest areas requiring study.","[Atkinson, Christopher J.; Fitzgerald, Jean D.; Hipps, Neil A.] E Malling Res, E Malling ME19 6BJ, Kent, England",,"Atkinson, CJ (corresponding author), E Malling Res, New Rd, E Malling ME19 6BJ, Kent, England.",chris.atkinson@emr.ac.uk,,,,,,,1238,1360,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2010.0,337,1-2,,,,1,18,,10.1007/s11104-010-0464-5,,,,,,,,WOS:000284159900001,

Here, we use econometric methods to evaluate the relationship between county-level socio-economic indicators and hydropower development for 56 Brazilian hydropower plants built between 1991 and 2010. We find that counties that built hydropower plants had greater GDP and tax revenues during their first few years of development than a control group that consisted of counties with hydropower projects planned but not yet built. However, those positive economic effects were short lived (< 15 years). We also find that social indicators (e.g. average income, life expectancy, educational level, access to piped water and public electricity, teenage pregnancy levels, and HIV cases) in counties that built hydropower did not statistically differ from those in the control counties. The results suggest that, for Brazil, justifications for hydropower projects based on local long-term economic and social development should be questioned, and that more effective mechanisms for turning local short-term economic growth into long-term development are needed.

Oil companies including BP and Shell recognized this early on and entered the solar industry when it was still in its relative infancy. These companies invested heavily in vertically integrated solar companies that were at one point among the largest in the world. But neither BP nor Shell was successful, and they both decided to exit the solar market. This stands as a paradox since such companies have the funds, the long-term perspectives, the management systems, the Multinational presence and the lobbying clout to potentially succeed in this new energy industry. Why were they not successful, and why did they ultimately exit? This paper uses innovation theory to explore the reasons why large incumbent corporations typically fail to succeed in commercializing disruptive innovations at scale. Evidence from semi-structured interviews and discussions with former employees of BP Solar and Shell Solar confirm the explanatory power of key constructs from innovation theory in accounting for the big oil companies' experience with solar technology.

We focus on the problem of what a designer should do if he/she has an algorithm that works correctly with sequential consistency but is faced with an underlying key-value store that provides a weaker (e.g., eventual or causal) consistency. We propose a detect-rollback based approach: The designer identifies a correctness predicate, say P, and continues to run the protocol, as our system monitors P. If P is violated (because the underlying key-value store provides a weaker consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the computation at a state where P holds. We evaluate this approach with practical graph applications running on the Voldemort key-value store. Our experiments, deployed on Amazon AWS EC2 instances, show that using eventual consistency with monitoring can provide a 50-80% increase in throughput when compared with sequential consistency. We also show that the overhead of the monitoring itself is low (typically less than 4%) and the latency of detecting violations is small. In particular, more than 99.9% of violations are detected in less than 50 milliseconds in regional AWS networks, and in less than 5 seconds in global AWS networks. In turn, this makes it possible to provide efficient recovery from such faults with a minimal amount of work wasted due to rollbacks.","[Duong Nguyen; Kulkarni, Sandeep S.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Charapko, Aleksey; Demirbas, Murat] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY USA",,"Nguyen, D (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",nguye476@cse.msu.edu; acharapk@buffalo.edu; sandeep@cse.msu.edu; demirbas@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,,,,,,67,76,,10.1109/LADC.2018.00017,,,,,,,,WOS:000469107300008,

The genus Haemulon (grunts) is one of the most important (numerically, ecologically, and economically) reef fish groups in the New World and an excellent candidate to test hypotheses of speciation and diversity generation in the Greater Caribbean, the richest Atlantic biodiversity hotspot, as well as the eastern Pacific. To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among the species of Haemulon, we obtained a combined total of 2639 base pairs from two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase 1), and two nuclear genes (TMO-4C4 and RAG2) from all nominal species. Parsimony, Maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses resulted in a well-resolved phylogeny with almost identical topologies. Previous phylogenetic hypotheses based on adult morphology, such as the close relationship among H. aurolineatum, H. boschmae, and H. striatum were not supported, whereas others using developmental characters, such as the relationship between H. plumieri and H. sciurus, were confirmed Our data. also indicate that the populations of the nominal H. steindachneri from the two sides of the Isthmus of Panama are genetically divergent at the species level in each ocean, and that the boga, Inermia vittata (family Inermiidae), belongs in the genus Haemulon. This evidence implies that there are 21 valid species of Haemulon, two more than previously recognized. The Amazon barrier and the Isthmus of Panama seem to have played roles in allopatric speciation of Haemulon. However, the majority of sister species pairs have completely overlapping distributions, indicating that vicariance is not the only process driving speciation in this genus. We conclude that both vicariance between biogeographic provinces, and ecological mechanisms of speciation within provinces contribute to species richness in the genus Haemulon. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Brazil is the world's largest beef exporter, exporting approximately one-fifth of its production, and the sector has a notable environmental footprint, linked to one-fifth of all commodity-driven deforestation across the tropics. By combining official per-shipment trade records, slaughterhouse export licenses, subnational agricultural statistics, and data on the origin of cattle per slaughterhouse, we mapped the flow of cattle from more than 2,800 municipalities where cattle were raised to 152 exporting slaughterhouses where they were slaughtered, via the 204 exporting and 3,383 importing companies handling that trade, and finally to 152 importing countries. We find stark differences in the subnational origin of the sourcing of different actors and link this supply chain mapping to spatially explicit data on cattle-associated deforestation, to estimate the deforestation risk (in hectares/year) of each supply chain actor over time.

A new feature of FaaS is function composition: a function may (sequentially) call another function, which, in turn, may call yet another function - forming a chain of invocations. From the perspective of the infrastructure, a composed FaaS is less opaque than a virtual machine or a container. We show that this additional information enables the infrastructure to reduce the response latency. In particular, knowing the sequence of future invocations, the infrastructure can schedule these invocations along with environment preparation. We model resource management in FaaS as a scheduling problem combining (1) sequencing of invocations, (2) deploying execution environments on machines, and (3) allocating invocations to deployed environments. For each aspect, we propose heuristics. We explore their performance by simulation on a range of synthetic workloads. Our results show that if the setup times are long compared to invocation times, algorithms that use information about the composition of functions consistently outperform greedy, myopic algorithms, leading to significant decrease in response latency.","[Zuk, Pawel; Rzadca, Krzysztof] Univ Warsaw, Inst Informat, Warsaw, Poland",,"Zuk, P (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Inst Informat, Warsaw, Poland.",p.zuk@mimuw.edu.pl; krzadca@mimuw.edu.pl,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2020.0,,,,,,132,140,,10.1109/SBAC-PAD49847.2020.00028,,,,,,,,WOS:000630462100017,

Landsat Thematic Mapper data were acquired concurrent with field surveys conducted in secondary forest fallows near Manaus, Brazil and Santa Cruz ae la Sierra, Bolivia. Measurements of age and above-ground live biomass were made in 34 regrowth stands. Satellite data were converted to surface reflectances and compared with regrowth stand age, biomass and structural variables. Among the Brazilian stands, significant relationships were observed between middle-infrared reflectance and stand age, height, volume and biomass. The canopy reflectance-biomass relationship saturated at around 15.0 kg m(-2), or over 15 years of age (r>0.80, p<0.01). In the Bolivian study area, no significant relationship between canopy spectral reflectance and biomass was observed. These contrasting results are probably caused by a low Sun angle during the satellite measurements from Bolivia. However, regrowth structural and general compositional differences between the two study areas could explain the lack of a significant relationship in Bolivia. The results demonstrate a current potential for biomass estimation of secondary forests with satellite optical data in some, but not all, tropical regions.

However, the increase in bioethanol production and consumption in the past couple of decades has been backed by the country's efforts and measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transport sector. Brazil is the second largest producer of biofuels, and its production continues to increase because of the commitments made in the Paris Agreement in 2015. This study reviews several key policies designed to develop Brazilian bioethanol production and to protect the environment. It is argued that many of these policies do not consider land use change or encourage land protection to achieve sustainable land use and agricultural production. Thus, this work aims to understand the importance and impacts of public policies in expanding sugarcane in Brazil in the past 34 years, with regard to land use and native vegetation. The discussion in this paper addresses the inadequacy of current policies to avoid direct and indirect land use change caused by sugarcane expansion, despite incentives such as 17 Sustainable Development Goals from the United Nations and certification schemes. The data presented indicate an indirect effect caused by the expansion of sugarcane over pasture areas, which leads to further clearing of natural vegetation to establish new pasture areas. Ultimately, this study addresses the importance of zero deforestation in Brazil, regardless of the crop that causes the conversion. Without conjoint efforts by all sectors of the economy to curtail deforestation, the sustainability of producing biofuels is not guaranteed, as the emissions caused by deforestation will not be offset by the lower GHG emissions obtained by using ethanol as a transport fuel.

Regular annual flooding maintains riparian forests through an intermediate disturbance regime. In response, seasonally flooded vegetation has developed adaptations for seed dispersal and gas transfer to survive and reproduce while undergoing periods of flooding. In the Amazon, a dam building boom threatens the integrity of riparian vegetation by moving riparian corridors into dry-adapted ecosystems and reducing downstream flooding of riparian areas. Additionally, the region is undergoing intense development pressure resulting in the conversion of native riparian vegetation into agriculture. In this study, we measure how the installation of six large dams on the Tocantins River, coupled with land cover change from native forest and savanna to cattle pasture, has changed the land-water interface of this region. Using land cover data provided by MapBiomas, we quantified land cover change from 1985 to 2018 and measured changes in the riparian areas of the still free-flowing areas of the Tocantins River, riparian areas surrounding reservoirs, and in-stream vegetation dynamics. We found that deforestation in the riparian areas of the Tocantins River downstream of the dams is occurring at a higher rate than deforestation in the watershed. Additionally, reservoir filling resulted in creating hundreds of square kilometers of new riparian areas, pushing the riparian zone away from forest-dominated ecosystems into savanna-dominated areas. The quantity of in-stream vegetation throughout the study was dynamic and initially increased after damming before declining for the last decade of the study. Changes to native land cover in riparian areas of the Tocantins River threaten the integrity of ecosystem services provided by riparian vegetation and are likely to lead to further degradation of these areas.","[Swanson, A.

Against a back drop of climate change, we analyze the Brazilian policy to expand National Forests (FLONAS) by 50 million hectares. Because these major environmental changes can generate spillovers in other sectors, we develop and use a CGE model that focuses on land and labor markets. Compared to climate change and deforestation in the baseline, the FLONAS scenario suggests relatively small declines in GDP, output (including agriculture) and other macro indicators. Urban households will experience declines in their welfare because they own most of the capital and land, which allows them to capture most of the deforestation benefits. In contrast, even though rural households have fewer opportunities for subsistence agriculture and face additional competition with other rural agricultural workers for more limited employment, their welfare improves due to health benefits from conservation of nearby forests. The efficiency vs. equity tradeoffs implied by the FLONAS scenario suggests that health-related ecosystem services will be underprovided if the rural poor are politically weaker than the urban rich.

Research was based on regional level analysis of remotely sensed and secondary data and local level analysis of the ways local populations use the resources at their disposal. The process observed departs significantly from what has been described in the literature for Latin America and should be seen as a window into a broader environmental process occurring in most tropical forests on the Pacific side of northern South America. Deforestation in the Northwest Ecuador is primarily related to a complex productive structure, made lip a countless number of timber producers and middlemen, ranging from fully informal to fully formal, and from small scale to large scale. A key finding is that local traditional populations play a critical role through productive coalitions between small primary producers and large timber firms. These have been shaped by the articulation of local conditions with external markets, settlement processes, and the convergence of local populations in an economic system which relies on the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. If deforestation rates in Northwest Ecuador remain at current levels, forests in the region will disappear completely within 30-35 years, a fate that is likely to be the same for most tropical rain forests west of the tropical Andes.","Arizona State Univ, Dept Geog, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; CARE Ecuador, Atlanta, GA USA",,"Sierra, R (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Geog, POB 840104, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,,,,,,,46,49,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,1998.0,26,1,,,,135,161,,10.1023/A:1018753018631,,,,,,,,WOS:000072857800007,

Altamira displays a rate of forest regrowth that is nearly twice as fast as Bragantina. Density, height, and basal area clearly distinguish between the rates succession in the Altamira and Bragantina regions. An eight year old fallow in Altamira has over four times the tree basel area of an eight year old fallow in Bargantina and a canopy which is nearly seven meters taller. The two regions' distinct rates of forest succession discard any uniform scenario for secondary succession in Amazonia, but point to similar features characterizing the over all process. Soil fertility and land use history emerge as the critical factors regrowth in these two regions. Our research has show that age alone cannot be used to predict stages of development of secondary succession, since local and regional differences in land use history and soil fertility can cause structural differences among sites within the same age class. Physiognomic parameters provide a mole consistent way of comparing secondary vegetation across sites and regions. We introduce a cross-regional classification system Sol successional stages based primarily on structural criteria. Succession is divided into three stages, initial (SS1), intermediate (SS2), and advanced (SS3). The features which uniquely identify each successional stage include 1.) the relative contribution of saplings (individuals < 10 cm and (3)2 cm DBH) and trees (individuals (3)10 cm DBH) to the total basal area, 2.) tree basal area, 3.) average total height, 4.) mode total height, 5.) average DBH, and 6.) the standard deviation of total height which indicates the degree of structural diversity among the plants. The relative contribution of saplings and trees to total basal area emerges as the primary indicator of each stage. From viewpoint of remote sensing and land use analysis, the difinition of structural parameters for regrowth stages is especially important, since structural features are associated with spectral data from satellite images. Regrowth stages based on structural criteria which can be identified independent of age will help facilitate the aggregation of cross-regional data sets, help to understand the pace of regrowth in relation to management strategies, and furthermore, aid the development of a basin-wide classification system of remotely sensed satellite images for secondary succession.","Univ Arizona, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Indiana Univ, ACT, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Indiana Univ, CIPEC, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",,"Tucker, JM (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",jtucker@u.arizona.edu; ebrondiz@indiana.edu; moran@indiana.edu,,,,,,,57,66,,,,,,,,,,,MAR-APR,1998.0,23,2,,,,64,+,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000073529100002,

Today, many instruments produce datasets that are too big to be downloaded to a local computer, yet many of the visualisation tools used by astronomers are deployed only on desktop computers. Cloud computing is increasingly used to provide a computation and simulation platform in astronomy, but it also offers great potential as a visualisation platform. Virtual hosted desktops, with graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, allow interactive, graphics-intensive desktop applications to operate co-located with astronomy datasets stored in remote data centres. By combining benchmarking and user experience testing, with a cohort of 20 astronomers, we investigate the viability of replacing physical desktop computers with virtual hosted desktops. In our work, we compare two Apple MacBook computers (one old and one new, representing hardware and opposite ends of the useful lifetime) with two virtual hosted desktops: one commercial (Amazon Web Services) and one in a private research cloud (the Australian NeCTAR Research Cloud). For two-dimensional image-based tasks and graphics-intensive three-dimensional operations - typical of astronomy visualisation workflows - we found that benchmarks do not necessarily provide the best indication of performance. When compared to typical laptop computers, virtual hosted desktops can provide a better user experience, even with lower performing graphics cards. We also found that virtual hosted desktops are equally simple to use, provide greater flexibility in choice of configuration, and may actually be a more cost-effective option for typical usage profiles.

Relevant information on the transitional changes of forested landscapes in the delta is poor compared to other tropical forests such as the Brazilian and Columbian Amazonian forest where numerous research studies have been conducted. Consequently, this study aimed at investigating the spatial extent and rates of forest transition in the Niger Delta region taking into consideration the patterns, causes and implications of the landscape dynamics. The study determined the spatial extent and rates of forest transition in the study area using remotely sensed data from 1986 and 2007. The results indicated that the spatial extent of deforestation, unchanged forest cover and afforestation were 1.38, 2.39, and 1.15 million hectares, respectively, while the annual deforestation and afforestation rates were 0.95 and 0.75% which are high compared to other areas in the humid tropics. The annual rate of change in forest cover was determined as -0.13% indicating an overall reduction in the spatial extent of forest cover for the entire delta. Changes in the spatial structure of forests were investigated using landscape metrics and the results showed there was a substantial increase in forest fragmentation. The variations in population dynamics and poverty indicators between different states of the Niger Delta were unable to explain the observed patterns of forest change. Instead, the authors observed that the main determinants of forest dynamics were the variations in state forest management policies and the influence of the oil and gas industry on the economies of the states. High rates of afforestation were found in states that have limited oil resources and were more economically dependent on forest products, while states with high deforestation rates were found in the main oil-producing parts of the study site. Using the present trend of forest transition dynamics, a 20-year forward simulation was generated using the Markov algorithm. The results concerning forest transition in the study area point to the urgent need for appropriate environmental policy development and implementation for the Niger Delta region.

The principle focus of the reserve design literature is on determining which sites to reserve to maximise the number of species conserved. A good reservation policy is one that conserves as many species as possible. Until recently, most site selection models have been static: they assumed that sites threatened by development would be reserved immediately after the optimal plan is determined. This rarely occurs in practice, often because there are insufficient funds available when the optimal plan is determined, or because not all sites are immediately available to be reserved. But once postponed, the reservation decisions might never be implemented if the targeted sites become developed first. Development often takes the form of a contagion process in which the sites most likely to become developed are near sites that have already been developed. This pattern is evident, for example, in Rondonia in Brazil, where the proximity of a site to the nearest deforested area is a strong determinant of the site's probability of being cleared. The strong dependence of site development risk on the site's proximity to cleared forest has also been found in more heavily developed countries such as Costa Rica. Importantly, this spreading contagion form of deforestation is found in much of the Brazilian Amazon and other frontier forests, which are the last remaining large tracts of ecologically intact forest. If such forests are to be conserved in efficient way, it is essential that interdependencies in site development risks be considered. Graph-theoretic models are thus important for addressing ecological management problems in which connectivity among sites and their dynamic properties need to be considered. Recently, several dynamic reserve site selection models of increasing complexity based on stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) have been proposed, allowing to model very large spatially explicit problems. Approximate heuristic solution methods and more recently simulation-based Reinforcement Learning (RL), have been developed. Here, we present the first application of this RL method to a (very) large realistic example. Namely, we used available data concerning Costa-Rica forest cover type and changes between 1997 and 2000 and required forest types and minimum areas for the persistence of 90 species of birds and mammals living there, in order to build a large SDP model. The complete model is huge since more than 19000 sites are modelled and the available yearly funding allows to conserve hundreds of hectares each year. Thus even RL method cannot solve such problems. To overcome the induced complexity, we propose to split the country in different zones containing a few hundreds threatened sites each and in which one site could be reserved each year. In this paper we illustrate our approach on one of these zones, containing 309 sites and 75 species present, 51 of each can be preserved. We now plan to deal with the full scale problem. Indeed, rather than considering completely independent subproblems of tractable sizes we will consider their dependencies and model the problem of efficiently allocating funds for reservation between zones each year.","[Sabbadin, R.; Bergonnier, E.] INRA Toulouse, Unite Biometrie & Intelligence Artificielle, BP 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Spring, D.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Biodivers, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",,"Sabbadin, R (corresponding author), INRA Toulouse, Unite Biometrie & Intelligence Artificielle, BP 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",sabbadin@toulouse.inra.fr; Daniel.Spring@sci.monash.edu.au,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2007.0,,,,,,2189,2195,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290030702035,

Satellites provide an opportunity to monitor changes in forest carbon caused by deforestation and degradation, but only after initial carbon densities have been assessed. New airborne approaches, especially light detection and ranging (LiDAR), provide a means to estimate forest carbon density over large areas, which greatly assists in the development of practical baselines. Here I present an integrated satellite-airborne mapping approach that supports high-resolution carbon stock assessment and monitoring in tropical forest regions. The approach yields a spatially resolved, regional state-of-the-forest carbon baseline, followed by high-resolution monitoring of forest cover and disturbance to estimate carbon emissions. Rapid advances and decreasing costs in the satellite and airborne mapping sectors are already making high-resolution carbon stock and emissions assessments viable anywhere in the world.","Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Asner, GP (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, 260 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gpa@stanford.edu,,,,,,,172,173,,,,,,,,,,,JUL-SEP,2009.0,4,3,,,,,,34009,10.1088/1748-9326/4/3/034009,,,,,,,,WOS:000270659300013,

Between VDCs with community forests and those without, there were large differences in the rate of total forested area loss, with community forest VDCs losing less total forested area over the 14-year period. Moreover, in the group of VDCs with community forests, high forest area increased by 77%, in comparison with 13% for VDCs without community forests. Higher shrub loss in community forest VDCs was attributable to conversion into high forest via plantation establishment and natural succession.

Recent studies have pointed out some limitations of single-date comparisons between years and have emphasized the usefulness of time series. However, less effort has hitherto been dedicated to properly account for the temporal dependences typifying the successive images of a time series. An automated change detection method based on a per-object approach and on a probabilistic procedure is proposed here to better cope with this issue. This innovative procedure is applied to a tropical forest environment using high temporal resolution SPOT-VEGETATION time series from 2001 and 2004 in the Brazilian state of Rondonia. The principle of the method is to identify the objects that most deviate from an unchanged reference defined by objective rules. A probabilistic changed-unchanged threshold provides a change map where each object is associated with a likelihood of having changed. This improvement on a binary diagnostic makes the method relevant to meet the requirements of different users, ranging from a comprehensive detection of changes to a detection of the most dramatic changes. According to the threshold value, overall accuracy indices of up to 91 % were obtained, with errors involving change omissions for the most part. The isolation of changes within objects was made possible through a segmentation procedure implemented in a temporal context. In addition, the method was formulated so as to differentiate between inter- and intra-annual vegetation dynamics. These technical peculiarities will likely make this analytical framework suitable for detecting changes in environments subject to a strongly marked phenology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We use a bromeliad phylogeny based on eight plastid regions to analyze relationships within the family, test a new, eight-subfamily classification, infer the chronology of bromeliad evolution and invasion of different regions, and provide the basis for future analyses of trait evolution and rates of diversification. . Methods : We employed maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian approaches to analyze 9341 aligned bases for four outgroups and 90 bromeliad species representing 46 of 58 described genera. We calibrate the resulting phylogeny against time using penalized likelihood applied to a monocot-wide tree based on plastid ndhF sequences and use it to analyze patterns of geographic spread using parsimony, Bayesian inference, and the program S-DIVA. . Results : Bromeliad subfamilies are related to each other as follows: (Brocchinioideae, (Lindmanioideae, (Tillandsioideae, (Hechtioideae, (Navioideae, (Pitcairnioideae, (Puyoideae, Bromelioideae))))))). Bromeliads arose in the Guayana Shield ca. 100 million years ago (Ma), spread centrifugally in the New World beginning ca. 16-13 Ma, and dispersed to West Africa ca. 9.3 Ma. Modern lineages began to diverge from each other roughly 19 Ma. . Conclusions : Nearly two-thirds of extant bromeliads belong to two large radiations: the core tillandsioids, originating in the Andes ca. 14.2 Ma, and the Brazilian Shield bromelioids, originating in the Serro do Mar and adjacent regions ca. 9.1 Ma.","[Givnish, Thomas J.; Van Ee, Benjamin; Riina, Ricarda; Gonsiska, Philip A.; Jabaily, Rachel S.; Sytsma, Kenneth J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Barfuss, Michael H.

The large uncertainty in emissions estimates is a consequence of many factors, including differences in definitions of forests and degradation, as well as estimation methodologies. However, a primary factor driving uncertainty is an inability to properly account for forest degradation. While remote sensing offers the only practical way of monitoring forest disturbances over large areas, and despite recent improvements in data quality and quantity and processing techniques, remote sensing approaches are still limited in their ability to detect forest degradation. In this paper, a system is presented that uses time series of Landsat data and spectral mixture analysis to detect both degradation and deforestation in forested landscapes. The Landsat data are transformed into spectral endmember fractions and are used to calculate the Normalized Degradation Fraction Index (NDFI; Souza et al., 2005). The spectrally unmixed data are used for disturbance monitoring and land cover classification via time series analysis. To assess the performance of the system, maps of deforestation and degradation were used to stratify the study area for collection of sample data to which unbiased estimators were applied to produce accuracy and area estimates of degradation and deforestation from 1990 to 2013. The approach extends previous research in spectral mixture analysis for identifying forest degradation to the temporal domain. The method was applied using the Google Earth Engine and tested in the Brazilian State of Rondonia. Degradation and deforestation were mapped with 88.0% and 93.3% User's Accuracy, and 68.1% and 85.3% Producer's Accuracy. Area estimates of degradation and deforestation were produced with margins of error of 13.9% and 5.3%, respectively, over the 24 year time period. These results indicate that for Rondonia a decreasing trend in deforestation after 2004 corresponds to an increase in degradation during the same time period.","[Bullock, Eric L.; Woodcock, Curtis E.; Olofsson, Pontus] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 685 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,"Bullock, EL (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 685 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",bullocke@bu.edu; curtis@bu.edu; olofsson@bu.edu,,,,,,,81,83,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1,2020.0,238,,,,,,,110968,10.1016/j.rse.2018.11.011,,,,,,,,WOS:000523955200010,

Biochar is defined as 'charcoal for application to soils.' It may be enriched in polycondensed aromatic C forms which enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration after soil application. For SOC sequestration to occur, all of the SOC sequestered must originate from the atmospheric CO2 pool and be transferred into the soil humus through land unit plants, plant residues, and other organic solids. Biochar can also be described as an anthropogenically produced black carbon (BC) material. BC also known as pyrogenic organic carbon (PyOC), fire-derived organic matter or wildfire charcoal, constitutes certain ranges in the combustion continuum ranging from slightly charred plant material to highly condensed soot. Application of biochar to soil has recently received increased attention as a means to sequester C and to produce secondary agronomic benefits. In particular, it is thought that application of charcoal together with organic wastes, dung, and bones is the cause of high SOC concentrations and sustained soil fertility by ancient agricultural management practices that created terra preta de Indio, deep black soils in the Brazilian Amazon. However, natural charcoal and biochar are not well suited as proxies for each other. Also, whether new terra preta can be generated by biochar application (together with organic wastes) to soils under other land uses, for different soil types and climates, is not known. In particular, the properties of organic materials (e.g., wood, manure, leaves) used as feedstock for biochar production and charring conditions (e.g., temperature, charring time) vary widely. Thus, the biological, chemical, and physical properties among biochars also vary widely. Biochar may be the most stable soil amendment with estimated mean residence times (MRTs) of several hundreds to thousands of years, and may increase nutrient availability beyond the fertilizer effect. Thus, applying biochar to the soil potentially improves soil productivity, SOC storage, and infiltration of percolating soil water in the long term through its porous structure and stability. However, interactions between soils and biochar are diverse and difficult to predict. For example, yield-stimulating effects of biochar are not universal, and may be restricted to the tropics as biochar increases yield through liming and fertilization, consistent with the low soil pH, low fertility, and low fertilizer inputs typical of arable tropical soils. Relatively few studies provide a quantitative assessment of biochar soil management scenarios. Needed are, in particular, large-scale long-term field studies on different crops at diverse locations designed to test effects of application of different biochar types on SOC sequestration and secondary agronomic benefits. Similarly, a routine standard method to quantify soil biochar C is essential but not yet available. This chapter begins with a comparison of biological, chemical, and physical properties of charred OM relevant to agricultural application. This is followed by a discussion about effects of application of charred OM on SOC sequestration. The chapter concludes with an overview of research gaps that need to be addressed to realize the full potential of biochar for SOC sequestration in agricultural soils. In this chapter, BC, char, charcoal, and PyOC are used interchangeably, whereas the term biochar will be used when anthropogenically charred biomass is purposefully applied to soil for agricultural and environmental benefits.","[Lorenz, Klaus; Lal, Rattan] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Lorenz, K (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,,,,,,301,355,,10.1007/978-3-319-92318-5_8,,,,,,,,WOS:000717140100009,

Location Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, Western Brazilian Amazon. Methods The investigated forests were of the low and the high varzea type, on an annual average flooded around 4 and 1 months, respectively. The two low-varzea forests belonged to the secondary and to the late-successional stage, the high-varzea forest also to the late-successional stage. A total of 24 circular sample plots covering 1885 m 2 were installed. They were nested within three rectangular 1 ha permanent sample plots where individuals greater than or equal to 10 cm d. b. h. were formerly inventoried. Average inundation and radiation [ relative photosynthetically active radiation (rPAR)] at the forest floor was recorded in all inventoried plots. The Mean spatial Distribution Center (MDC; Ebdon, 1998) for all sapling species was calculated. Sapling species were grouped into associations with respect to their light-demand and their location along the flood-level gradient. Results Average flood height and average rPAR at the forest floor was highest in the secondary stage of the low varzea and lowest in the high-varzea forest. Overall average density and basal area of the saplings averaged 2250 individuals and 2.3 m(2) ha(-1) in the secondary stage, 2330 individuals and 2.6 m(2) ha(-1) in the late-successional stage of the low varzea and 5000 individuals and 4.8 m(2) ha(-1) in the high varzea. In all forest types, species richness of saplings was lower than species richness of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm d. b. h., and amounted to 25 species in the secondary stage, to 35 species in the late-successional stage of the low varzea and to 88 species in the high-varzea forest. The amount of 'immigrants' (Bazzaz, 1991) at the sapling level increased with proceeding forest succession and amounted to 24 and 29% in the low varzea and to 31% in the high varzea. Sapling species distribution, species richness and individual density was linked to both, the gradient of flooding and the gradient of irradiation. Species richness and individual density was highest in the high varzea and decreased with increasing influence of flooding. The high varzea was predominated by pronounced shade-tolerant sapling species, whereas in the low varzea occured both, light demanding and shade-tolerant species groups. Main conclusions Influence of flooding seems to be the main factor triggering species composition and structure of sapling communities in varzea forests. Proceeding forest succession reduces the impact of flooding because of the biogenical induced silting up of the forested sites. However, forest succession also alters forest architecture of the overstory and such the light conditions at the sapling level. Therefore, radiation is an important factor influencing species composition of sapling communities in varzea forests.","Max Planck Inst Limnol, D-24302 Plon, Germany",,"Wittmann, F (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Limnol, Postfach 165,August Thienemannstr 2, D-24302 Plon, Germany.",,,,,,,,57,67,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2003.0,30,10,,,,1533,1544,,10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00966.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000185535800005,

This article develops a simple model and taps into a unique data set on timber prices of hardwood and softwood in leading markets to test the global timber markets hypothesis. While we find evidence of a global equilibrating mechanism with potentially significant economic incentives to affect tropical deforestation, our results do not endorse the common conjecture in the literature that timber price shocks in developed countries lead to a homogeneous response in terms of deforestation everywhere in the tropical world.

Hyperspectral remote sensing with the imaging spectrometer specMACS provided cloud microphysical information for sun-illuminated cloud sides. In order to derive profiles of phase or effective radius from cloud side observations, vertical location information is indispensable. For this purpose, spectral measurements of cloud-side-reflected radiation in the oxygen A absorption band collected by specMACS were used to determine absorption path length between cloud sides and the instrument aboard the aircraft. From these data, horizontal distance and eventually vertical height were derived. It is shown that, depending on aircraft altitude and sensor viewing direction, an unambiguous relationship of absorption and distance exists and can be used to retrieve cloud geometrical parameters. A comparison to distance and height information from stereo image analysis (using data of an independent camera) demonstrates the efficiency of the approach. Uncertainty estimates due to method, instrument and environmental factors are provided. The main sources of uncertainty are unknown in cloud absorption path contributions due to complex 3-D geometry or unknown microphysical properties, variable surface albedo and aerosol distribution. A systematic difference of 3.8 km between the stereo and spectral method is found which can be attributed to 3-D geometry effects not considered in the method's simplified cloud model. If this offset is considered, typical differences found are 1.6 km for distance and 230 m for vertical position at a typical distance around 20 km between sensor and convective cloud elements of typically 1-10 km horizontal and vertical extent.","[Zinner, Tobias; Schwarz, Ulrich; Koelling, Tobias; Ewald, Florian; Mayer, Bernhard] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Meteorol Inst, Munich, Germany; [Jaekel, Evelyn; Wendisch, Manfred] Univ Leipzig, Leipziger Inst Meteorol, Leipzig, Germany; [Ewald, Florian] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany",,"Zinner, T (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Meteorol Inst, Munich, Germany.",tobias.zinner@lmu.de,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 25,2019.0,12,2,,,,1167,1181,,10.5194/amt-12-1167-2019,,,,,,,,WOS:000459579500001,

Our analysis encompasses two typical cases of iCL in Mato Grosso (the rotation of soy followed by pasture, and soy followed by maize and pasture) as well as biophysical, socioeconomic, and institutional factors observable at the household and/or municipality levels that may influence the wide scale occurrence of iCL. Evidence at both scales suggests that knowledge and supply chain infrastructure play an important role in early occurrence of iCL, as they are more common in regions closer to iCL research stations and processing facilities of grains and cattle. On average iCL adopters are more educated and have better access to technical assistance and sector information than specialized farmers or ranchers. Most iCLs are concentrated near established soy areas and greater similarity exists between municipalities with iCL and soy-dominant municipalities vs. pasture-dominant municipalities. Our findings reveal the importance of specific conditions for iCL occurrence and iCL promotion in livestock-dominant regions. Incentives targeted at ranchers are crucial for the achievement of the Brazilian Government's goal to restore degraded pastures through agricultural intensification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For comparison, a mature forest stand was surveyed. A systematic sampling design was applied. On average, 10.2 trees/ha with a bole volume of 66.5 m(3)/ha were removed. Up to the mid-1980s, covered by this study, only Bombacopsis quinata, Swietenia. macrophylla, Cedrela odorata and Cordia apurensis were logged. The 5-, 8- and 19-year old logged stands showed a mean basal area of 17.8, 21.3 and 22.2 m(2)/ha, respectively, whereas 33.2 m2/ha were measured in the mature forest. The share of undamaged trees in the basal area increased from 30.8% in the 5-year old logged stand to 43.9% in the oldest logged stand. The number of emergent trees (>30 m height) was considerably reduced by logging; even 19 years after logging only 8 stems/ha were found in this height class comparing to 51 stems/ha in the mature forest. B. quinata, the most important timber species in the study area, occurred with only two heavily deformed individuals in the logged stands. Juveniles of B. quinata were rare (<10 stems/ha) in both logged and unlogged stands. A similar situation was found in C. odorata and S. macrophylla. In contrast, C. apurensis was well represented in small size classes in logged and unlogged areas. A second cutting cycle will be based on a variety of medium and small-sized shade-tolerant and light-demanding species which were regularly distributed in the unlogged and logged area. However, the spatial patterns of seedlings and saplings of these species did not show any clear trend. Nineteen years after logging, only one-third (61.3 m(3)/ha) of the commercial hole volume of the mature forest (185.3 m(3)/ha) was attained.

Vegetation height was recovered from airborne SAR interferometry, and was used along with an established relationship between forest height and age for mapping the successional stages of vegetation. A map of forest ages could be generated and validated (age RMSE was 3.5 years). Biomass stocks and annual rates of increment in biomass could be attributed to the forest ages by a comprehensive growth model for forests in the study area. A conceptual model of land use change was developed for the study area that accounts for four different types of land use: primary forest, secondary forest, degraded forest and nonforest. The transition probabilities between those land use types were recovered from internal modeling of available data, from literature sources, and from large-scale remote sensing results. The land use change matrix, area-age densities of secondary forests, and a growth model, yield a spatialized estimate of the carbon budget. The committed emissions from annual land use change were computed. For the year 2000-2001 the carbon balance was negative, on an area of ca. 5700 ha, land use dynamics resulted in a release of approximately 16,000 t of carbon, mainly arising from the cutting of primary forest for agricultural purposes. The secondary forest carbon budget was almost balanced, and forest degradation was revealed less important. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The latter species is especially variable in plant size and persistence of the hairy indument, which can be correlated with local ecological conditions.

Dicksonia stuebelii is maintained as a separate species and is reported from northern Colombia for the first time. One species is recognized as new, D. lehnertiana; it is characterized by relatively small, long-stalked fronds with spreading bristly hairs. Results of an S-DIVA biogeographical analysis implemented on an updated phylogeny of Neotropical Dicksonia separate D. sellowiana in southeastern Brazil clearly from the rest of the taxa, whose ancestral area is reconstructed as northern Andes-southern Mesoamerica.

This paper analyzes the influence of a newly established concession system on forest landscape change. Specifically, the paper examines whether the concession system promoted and increased land-cover changes and changed fragmentation patterns between 2001 and 2010. Classified Landsat images at 2-year intervals from 2001 to 2003 and 2006 to 2010 were used to examine trajectories in forest, non-forest and regrowth areas. Non-linear changes were found to have occurred in each of the forest classes. Changes in fragmentation varied in size, density, aggregation and configuration over the study period. Forest reforms account for changes in specific land-cover classes through pattern dynamics within timber concessions. However, not all results relate to landscape pattern metrics. Although new forest legislation has been important in reorganizing the forest sector, other causal factors including levels of technological and managerial expertise, credit availability and law enforcement structures play a decisive role in the successive implementation of forest legislation.","[Chavez, Andrea B.] Univ Nacl Amazonica Madre de Dios, Geospatial Ctr Nat Resource Management Res, Puerto Maldonado, Peru; [Cossio, Rosa E.] Consultant Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMM, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh",,"Chavez, AB (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Amazonica Madre de Dios, Geospatial Ctr Nat Resource Management Res, Av Jorge Chavez S-N, Puerto Maldonado, Peru.",andreabirgitchavez@gmail.com,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2014.0,13,3,,,,349,366,,10.1007/s11842-013-9258-y,,,,,,,,WOS:000340519300006,

Abundance and number of epiphytic aroid species per phorophyte were significantly higher than in upland forest, and the species composition varied conspicuously between the two forest types.

After separating from the retroflection region, the so-called NBC rings travel northwestward along the Brazilian coast, until they reach the island chain of the Lesser Antilles and disintegrate. These rings contribute substantially to the upper limb return flow of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation by carrying South Atlantic Water into the northern subtropical gyre. Their relevance for the northward transport of South Atlantic Water depends on the frequency of their generation as well as on their horizontal and vertical structure. The ring shedding and propagation and the complex interaction of the rings with the Lesser Antilles are investigated in the 1/12 degrees Family of Linked Atlantic Model Experiments (FLAME) model. The ring properties simulated in FLAME reach the upper limit of the observed rings in diameter and agree with recent observations on seasonal variability, which indicates a maximum shedding during the first half of the year. When the rings reach the shallow topography of the Lesser Antilles, they are trapped by the island triangle of St. Lucia, Barbados and Tobago and interact with the island chain. The model provides a resolution that is capable of resolving the complex topographic conditions at the islands and illuminates various possible fates for the water contained in the rings. It also reproduces laboratory experiments that indicate that both cyclones and anticyclones are formed after a ring passes through a topographic gap. Trajectories of artificial floats, which were inserted into the modeled velocity field, are used to investigate the pathways of the ring cores and their fate after they encounter the Lesser Antilles. The majority of the floats entered the Caribbean, while the northward Atlantic pathway was found to be of minor importance. No prominent pathway was found east of Barbados, where a ring could avoid the interaction with the islands and migrate toward the northern Lesser Antilles undisturbed.","[Jochumsen, Kerstin; Rhein, Monika; Huettl-Kabus, Sabine] Univ Bremen, Inst Umweltphys, Abt Ozeanog, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Boening, Claus W.] Univ Kiel, Leibniz Inst Meereswissensch, D-24148 Kiel, Germany",,"Jochumsen, K (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Meereskunde, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",kerstin.jochumsen@zmaw.de,,,,,,,11,12,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2,2010.0,115,,,,,,,C10004,10.1029/2009JC006042,,,,,,,,WOS:000282511200004,

The unique challenges our framework tackles are related to the combinatorial explosion of the space that contains the possible solutions, and the robustness of long-running computations. Not only is the time required to finish the computations unknown, but also the resource requirements may change during the course of the computation. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by using it to solve challenging problems using two separate large-scale distribution paradigms.

We show that companies along the soy-meat value chain have made different sustainability commitments probably because they are facing very different risk factors: those upstream such as soy traders are concerned mainly with international pressures associated with deforestation, whilst those further downstream in the supply chain have from very loose to very ambitious sustainability objectives on various topics associated with the sector including animal welfare, climate change and human-health. We found that these supply chain initiatives are not addressing sufficiently the cause and effect of key drivers of sectoral impacts such as land appreciation and the global demand for cheap meat. Further, because the soy-meat sector is vertically integrated both upstream and downstream, this may result in comparable bargaining power among business actors such that none of these actors may be able to impose sustainability norms without inferring cost onto themselves or causing perverse outcomes. A lack of coordination in market governance is translating into a lack of uptake in various instruments (e.g. certification) or transference of cost and responsibilities onto soy producers (e.g. deforestation free standard such as the Soy Moratorium). A perverse outcome of the latter is the displacement of impacts onto other regions and commodities. In light of these challenges in market governance, we encourage more emphasis on network governance, which involves more social interactions that build trust, vision and exchanges of information and resources (e.g. between Brazil and China and Europe), these being more important in early phases of transitions for systems facing sustainability gridlock.

Ground-truthed satellite image analysis indicates that between 1987 and 1996, net forest regrowth occurred in the 1015 km(2) study region. While some forest regrowth can be attributed to a 1987 ban on logging, the area of forest regrowth greatly exceeds that of previously clear-cut areas. Further, new area was also deforested between 1987 and 1996. Thus, the observed land-cover changes most likely represent a complex mosaic of changing land-use patterns across time and space. Using satellite imagery from 1987, 1991 and 1996, we estimate a series of models, including binary probit models for each date, and a random-effects probit model using panel techniques. We also experiment with spatial sampling schemes designed to reduce residual spatial autocorrelation, and qualitatively compare the impact of spatial sampling on model accuracy. Lastly, we find that changes in relative prices, infrastructure improvement, and topography are all significantly related to changing land-cover patterns. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Forestry projects have been shown to be easier to quantify and monitor than national inventories, partly because not all pools need measuring: a selective accounting system can be used that must include all pools expected to decrease and a choice of pools expected to increase as a result of the project. Only pools that are based on field measurements should be incorporated into the calculation of carbon benefits. Such a system allows for trade-offs between expected carbon benefits, costs, and desired precision, while maintaining the integrity of the net carbon benefits. Techniques and methods for accurately and precisely measuring individual carbon pools in forestry projects exist, are based on peer reviewed principles of forest inventory, soil sampling, and ecological surveys, and have been well tested in many part of the world. Experience with several forestry projects in tropical countries has shown that with the use of these techniques carbon stocks can readily be estimated to be within less than +/-10% of the mean. To date, there is little experience with measuring the changes in carbon stocks over time but, using the correct design and sufficient numbers of permanent plots, it is expected that precision levels will be maintained at less than +/-10% of the mean. Internal verification can be accomplished through use of quality assurance/quality control plans. External or third-party verification is still in its infancy, and would greatly benefit from international agreements in relation to protocols used for all aspects of project design and implementation.","Winrock Int Livestock Res & Training Ctr, Arlington, VA 22209 USA",,"Brown, S (corresponding author), Winrock Int Livestock Res & Training Ctr, Suite 1200,1621 N Kent St, Arlington, VA 22209 USA.",,,,,,,,65,68,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 15,2002.0,360,1797,,,,1669,1683,,10.1098/rsta.2002.1026,,,,,,,,WOS:000177340500008,

Capacities for measuring the extent of the damage are essential to the calculation of carbon emissions under REDD+ programmes (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). Remote sensing is a powerful tool to provide this type of information (e.g. on logging, mining or infrastructure projects). Various techniques have been used to identify and quantify canopy opening. A further step is to cross-reference past and present canopy opening in order to document the recovery of ecosystems after logging. The method proposed in this article involves a semi-automatic processing chain adapted for LANDSAT imagery. During post-processing, canopy opening information is extracted by means of specific algorithms. A spatial index, calibrated to a low-resolution radiometer, indicates present and past degrees of opening. This process produces estimations of forest degradation that can describe low-resolution remotely-sensed data (such as MODIS) used in continental mapping. These estimations are then cross-referenced with continental land cover maps to gain insights into present-day forest categories. This tool was developed under the CoForChange project, whose overall objective is to predict changes in forests and in tree species distribution in the Congo Basin as a result of global change, and to develop decision-making tools.

These changes combined with the action of climatic factors led, in most cases, to negative effects increasing the risk of degradation of agricultural land. This study aims to assess and monitor the risk of land degradation in Baragan Plain, Romania, for the period 1988-2011 using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA). Each satellite image was classified through the Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) method; then, on the basis of certain threshold values, we obtained maps of land degradation and maps showing the passage from various classes of land use/land cover (LULC) to land degradation. The results indicate that during the intermediary periods there was an ascending and descending trend in the risk of land degradation determined by the interaction of climatic factors with the social-economic ones. For the entire period, the overall trend was ascending, the risk of land degradation increasing by around 4.60 % of the studied surface. Out of the climatic factors, high temperatures and, implicitly, drought were the most significant. The social-economic factors are the result of the changes which occurred after the fall of the communist regime, the most important being the fragmentation of agricultural land and the destruction of the irrigation system.","[Vorovencii, Iosif] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Forest Management & Engn Dept, Fac Silviculture, Beethoven St 1, Brasov, Romania",,"Vorovencii, I (corresponding author), Transilvania Univ Brasov, Forest Management & Engn Dept, Fac Silviculture, Beethoven St 1, Brasov, Romania.",iosif.vorovencii@unitbv.ro,,,,,,,7,8,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2016.0,188,7,,,,,,439,10.1007/s10661-016-5446-5,,,,,,,,WOS:000378840300056,

This paper introduces a feature reduction method based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). This SVD-based feature reduction method reduces the storage and processing requirements of the SVD by utilizing a training dataset. This feature reduction technique was applied to training data from two multitemporal datasets of Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery acquired over a forested area in Virginia, USA and Rondonia, Brazil. Subsequent parallel iterative guided spectral class rejection (pIGSCR) forest/non-forest classifications were performed to determine the quality of the feature reduction. The classifications of the Virginia data were five times faster using SVD-based feature reduction without affecting the classification accuracy. Feature reduction using the SVD was also compared to feature reduction using principal components analysis (PCA). The highest average accuracies for the Virginia dataset (88.34%) and for the Rondonia dataset (93.31%) were achieved using the SVD. The results presented here indicate that SVD-based feature reduction can produce statistically significantly better classifications than PCA.

This study focuses on the north-west boundary of the Argentine Semi-arid Chaco, where soybean is the most important crop. Deforestation was estimated for areas with different levels of soil and rainfall limitation for agriculture between 1972 and 200 1, with a finer analysis in three periods starting in 1984, which are characterized by differences in rainfall, soybean price, production cost, technology-driven yield and national gross domestic product. Between 1972 and 2001, 588 900 ha (c. 20% of the forests) were deforested. Deforestation has been accelerating, reaching > 28000 ha yr(-1) after 1997. The initial deforestation was associated with black bean cultivation following an increase in rainfall during the 1970s. In the 1980s, high soybean prices stimulated further deforestation. Finally, the introduction of soybean transgenic cultivars in 1997 reduced plantation costs and stimulated a further increase in deforestation. The domestic economy had little association with deforestation. Although deforestation was more intense in the moister (rainfall > 600 mm yr(-1)) areas, more than 300 000 ha have already been deforested in the drier areas, suggesting that climatic limitations are being overcome by technological and genetic improvement. Furthermore, more than 300 000 ha of forest occur in sectors without major soil and rainfall limitations. If global trends of technology, soybean markets and climate continue, and no active conservation policies are applied, vast areas of the Chaco will be deforested in the coming decades.","Univ Nacl Tucuman, CONICET, Lab Invest Ecol Yungas, RA-4107 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, Rio Piedras, PR 00931 USA",,"Grau, HR (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Tucuman, CONICET, Lab Invest Ecol Yungas, Casilla Correo 34,Yerba Buena, RA-4107 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina.",chilograu@yahoo.com.ar,,,,,,,174,192,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2005.0,32,2,,,,140,148,,10.1017/S0376892905002092,,,,,,,,WOS:000232758000005,

Because these occurrences coincide with the onset of human colonisation of the region, students of Amazonia discuss the extent to which it's Holocene fire record reflects climatically-related and/or anthropogenic causes. One factor that complicates inferences is the overall heterogeneity of the basin's vegetation: during drier moments of the Holocene and/or within less humid sub-regions of the basin, it is difficult to conclude whether fire signals reflect more frequent natural fires or more intense burning by human communities. Another factor is that pre-Columbian livelihoods were not homogenously distributed throughout the region and changed over the course of the Holocene. This paper seeks to help establish an 'anthropogenic baseline' against which Holocene evidence for burning can be assessed. To this end, it reviews the role that slash-and-burn cultivation has had in discussions about pre-Columbian Amazonia, discusses how this account has been modified by recent research on pre-Columbian anthropogenic soils, and queries the extent to which the regionally-heterogeneous timing of crop domestication and cultivation may have influenced the fire history of pre-Columbian Amazonia.

It is argued that the cycling of secondary vegetation by shifting cultivators represents a form of rotation analogous to the foresters' case. The model. developed explains the empirical observation that individual agents use multiple rotation ages, and it does so for the nonmarket case,which is consistent with the institutional environment of many indigenous peoples and colonists.

Located in a tropical wet dry climate, the middle Araguaia River has an extensive and complex alluvial floodplain composed of a mosaic of geomorphologic units, dense alluvial forest, and many floodplain lakes. The Araguaia River is not currently dammed, and thus it provides an opportunity to analyze flooding hydrology in a relatively un-altered tropical system. Using average daily discharge measurements from 1975 to 2011, we analyze patterns of peak discharge attenuation (defined as the reduction in absolute peak discharge in m(3) s(-1)). We link peak discharge attenuation to bankfull discharge, explore whether peak discharge attenuation results in increased base level flows in the dry season following peak discharge, and use a simplified short-term water budget to determine whether peak discharge attenuation results in the loss of discharge from the channel over the flooding season (November to May). In addition, we explore other potential factors causing peak discharge attenuation, including surface water connectivity between the channel and floodplain lakes and floodplain lake area change between the dry season and the wet season. Although fluvial connectivity between the main channel and the floodplains starts before bankfull stage, we find that large peak discharge attenuation (up to 30% reduction in peak discharge) in the middle Araguaia usually occurs when the river rises above bankfull discharge. The river flow that is lost to the flood plain and floodplain lakes when peak discharge attenuation occurs usually returns to the channel by the end of the flooding season. However, the odds of increased baseflows in the dry season after flooding seasons with peak discharge attenuation are higher compared to flooding seasons without peak discharge attenuation for one of the studied reaches. Some types of floodplain lakes greatly increase in area from the dry season to the wet season, and many floodplain lakes become connected via surface water in the wet season. We have not found similar examples of peak attenuation in this type of tropical wet-dry floodplain system, indicating that the middle Araguaia River may be a unique system or that further research is needed.

Here we compare six published case studies of rapid commodity crop expansion within forested tropical regions. Across cases, between 1.7% and 89.5% of new commodity cropland was sourced from forestlands. Four main factors controlled pathways of commodity crop expansion: (i) the availability of suitable forestland, which is determined by forest area, agroecological or accessibility constraints, and land use policies, (ii) economic and technical characteristics of agricultural systems, (iii) differences in constraints and strategies between small-scale and large-scale actors, and (iv) variable costs and benefits of forest clearing. When remaining forests were unsuitable for agriculture and/or policies restricted forest encroachment, a larger share of commodity crop expansion occurred by conversion of existing agricultural lands, and land use displacement was smaller. Expansion strategies of large-scale actors emerge from context-specific balances between the search for suitable lands; transaction costs or conflicts associated with expanding into forests or other state-owned lands versus smallholder lands; net benefits of forest clearing; and greater access to infrastructure in already-cleared lands. We propose five hypotheses to be tested in further studies: (i) land availability mediates expansion pathways and the likelihood that land use is displaced to distant, rather than to local places; (ii) use of already-cleared lands is favored when commodity crops require access to infrastructure; (iii) in proportion to total agricultural expansion, large-scale actors generate more clearing of mature forests than smallholders; (iv) property rights and land tenure security influence the actors participating in commodity crop expansion, the form of land use displacement, and livelihood outcomes; (v) intensive commodity crops may fail to spare land when inducing displacement.

Palynomorphs are fairly well-preserved although many contain abundant pyrite. The whole assemblage is composed of 48 species of which six are spores. Among the pollen grains, 21 are monosaccate and 19 bisaccate (11 striate species). Scarce scolecodonts, microforaminifera and algae are also present. Two assemblages are recognized on the basis of the stratigraphic distribution of species, mainly of the striate pollen grains. The lower assemblage (A1) is dominated by amorphous organic matter and scarce monosaccate pollen grains, trilete spores and microforaminifera. The upper assemblage (A2) is dominated by tracheids and brown and black phytoclasts and characterized by more diverse palynomorphs, mainly striate and non-striate pollen grains. The geographical and stratigraphic distribution of taxa reveals that many species are recorded from Pennsylvanian and Permian palynofloras elsewhere in Gondwana and Euramerica. The presence of Lahirites segmentatus, Limitisporites scitulus, Lunatisporites onerosus and Vittatina species, common with Brazilian palynofloras, supports a Moscovian age for the assemblage 2. This age is also supported by calcareous microfossils previously found in the same interval of this borehole. Twenty two species are first records in the Pennsylvanian of Bolivia (e.g., Florinites eremus, Protohaploxypinus varius, Striatopodocarpites antiquus, S. gondwanensis, S. solitus, Vittatina sp.). Palynofacies features of both assemblages are indicative of a shallow marine palaeoenvironment. Qualitative changes on the floral composition between A1 and A2 may reflect broadly local palaeoclimatical changes. The dominance of Cordaitales and Coniferales in A1 indicates a relatively more humid local condition than during A2 time, which is characterized by the appearance of abundant and diverse striate pollen grains related to new groups of Pteridosperms. These features are in agreement with a lower humidity or seasonally and conditions prevailing in the terrestrial landscape near to the Copacabana marine palaeoenvironment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The scores assigned to 118 farmers in three study areas in Peten were analyzed through analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify the factors that account for the variation in intensity levels, as measured through the index. The analyses reveal that the factors influencing agricultural intensity in Peten vary greatly from one study area to the next. This is due to differences in livelihood opportunities and strategies that, in turn, affect how agriculture fits into the local economy and how and why intensification is pursued. Variation in intensity levels can best be understood by considering the factors at the household and sub-regional scales that influence (a) whether farmers feel a need to intensify, (b) whether they see some benefit in doing so, and (c) whether they have the resources required to intensify production through particular strategies. Close attention must be paid to these factors by conservation and development organizations seeking to influence land use patterns and conserve forest in Peten.","Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Urban & Reg Planning Program, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",,"Shriar, AJ (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Urban & Reg Planning Program, 923 W Franklin St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",ajshriar@vcu.edu,,,,,,,11,17,,,,,,,,,,,WIN,2005.0,22,4,,,,395,410,,10.1007/s10460-005-3395-7,,,,,,,,WOS:000234586600002,

Killed biomass was not a fixed proportion, but varied with unlogged biomass, with 24% killed in the lower-biomass region, and 37% in the higher-biomass region. Across the two regions logging resulted in a mean aboveground carbon loss of 35 +/- 2.8 Mg/ha. The plotless technique proved efficient at estimating mean aboveground biomass and logging damage.

We estimate that at an international carbon price of $10/tCO(2)e, a mandatory incentive structure, such as a cap-and-trade or symmetric tax-and-subsidy program, would have reduced emissions by 163-247 MtCO(2)e/y (20-31% below the without-REDD+ reference scenario), while generating a programmatic budget surplus. In contrast, a basic voluntary incentive structure modeled after a standard payment-for-environmental-services program would have reduced emissions nationally by only 45-76 MtCO(2)e/y (6-9%), while generating a programmatic budget shortfall. By making four policy improvements-paying for net emission reductions at the scale of an entire district rather than site-by-site; paying for reductions relative to reference levels that match business-as-usual levels; sharing a portion of district-level revenues with the national government; and sharing a portion of the national government's responsibility for costs with districts-an improved voluntary incentive structure would have been nearly as effective as a mandatory incentive structure, reducing emissions by 136-207 MtCO(2)e/y (17-26%) and generating a programmatic budget surplus.","[Busch, Jonah; Godoy, Fabiano; Steininger, Marc; Hewson, Jenny; Juhn, Daniel] Conservat Int, Sci & Knowledge Div, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Lubowski, Ruben N.] Environm Def Fund, Int Climate Program, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Yusuf, Arief A.] Padjadjaran State Univ, Dept Econ, Bandung 40115, Indonesia; [Austin, Kemen] World Resources Inst, People & Ecosyst Program, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Farid, Muhammad] Conservat Int, Asia Pacific Field Div, Jakarta 12550, Indonesia; [Boltz, Frederick] Conservat Int, Global Initiat, Arlington, VA 22202 USA",,"Busch, J (corresponding author), Conservat Int, Sci & Knowledge Div, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",jbusch@conservation.org,,,,,,,72,73,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 24,2012.0,109,4,,,,1062,1067,,10.1073/pnas.1109034109,,,,,,,,WOS:000299412600020,

Life cycles, habitats, behavior, and other parameters were investigated in the eight tiger beetle species inhabiting open areas in white- and blackwater floodplains near Manaus. Populations of larvae and adult beetles were observed during monthly field excursions during 1997-1999 to follow larval and adult phenology and to determine habitats and other parameters. Adult beetles were regularly taken to the laboratory for examination of gonad maturity, occasionally also for submersion experiments and to obtain eggs for rearing larvae to the adult beetle under controlled conditions. Larvae, too, were collected in the field and taken to the laboratory for submersion experiments and for rearing to the adult beetle. Submersion tolerance/resistance in the field was estimated by calculating the longest duration of inundation survived (using water gauge data) and from other observations. In the laboratory, maximum survival in water (without sediment) was tested in adult beetles of five species, in active larvae of four species, and in dormant larvae of one species. In addition, maximum survival in larvae submerged in sediment (simulating natural flooding conditions) was tested in two species. Here we complete information from previous contributions on life cycles in the four Phaeoxantha species, as well as on habitats and activity patterns of all eight species. Data are given on the life cycle of Tetracha sobrina punctata, Pentaconia cribrata (both field and laboratory data), Tetracha, spinosa, and (Cylindera suturalis (field observations). These four species have annual life cycles with a short larval phase (3-4 months) during low water periods and with adult beetles surviving the inundation period. Adult life span was long (>9 months) and is likely to involve a gonad dormancy in both sexes. This type of life cycle contrasts with findings in Phaeoxantha species. These also showed annual life cycles, but the larval phase was long (>7-10 months), including submersion resistance in larvae (shown for I? klugii and I? lindemannae, presumed for P aequinoctialis bifasciata), and adult life span is either short or long. Submersion resistance in the field and when being submerged in sediment in the laboratory was >3-4 months in larval I? klugii and P lindemannae. However, submersion resistance of active larvae in water without sediment was only a few days (P. klugii, P. lindemannae, P a. bifasciata, and T s. punctata) and >15 days in dormant larvae oil? klugii. Hence, submersion resistance in active larvae was low in species representing both life cycle types. Resistance is apparently enhanced by dormancy, although further factors are likely to be involved, as field data show a much higher resistance still. Adult beetles were not resistant to submersion (maximum survival <15 or <10 h, Phaeoxantha klugii, lindemannae, P limata, P acquinoctialis ssp., and Tetracha spinosa). Data on egg numbers, sex ratio, prey spectrum. predators and parasites, and on behavior are given and discussed for several of the species. Based on their life cycle, two different types of survival strategy can be assigned to the tiger beetle species inhabiting open habitats: Phaeoxantha species show a non-migratory type with flood resistant larvae, whereas P cribrata, C suturalis, and Tetracha, species exhibit a migratory type with adults passing the inundation period. The specific sets of phenological, physiological, and ethological adaptations characterizing these two types of survival strategy are discussed.","[Zerm, Matthias; Adis, Joachim] Max Planck Inst Limnol, Trop Ecol Working Grp, D-24302 Plon, Germany",,"Zerm, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Limnol, Trop Ecol Working Grp, Postfach 165, D-24302 Plon, Germany.",mzerm@mpil-ploen.mpg.de,,,,,,,17,17,,,,,,,,,,,,2001.0,7,1-2,,,,115,137,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000209348500010,

The flowering of T. bicolor showed a positive correlation (r > 0.75) with the months with higher temperature and solar radiation. We recorded an average per tree of 7 +/- 5 fruits. We found a drastic loss of 84% of fruits in the plants infested by the mistletoe O. cf. alveolatus and of 29% when infested by the fungus M. roreri.

Several scenarios believed to be representative of current Peruvian aquaculture practices were modelled, namely: production of trout in Andean lake cages; and culture of black pacu and tilapia in Amazonian and coastal lowland ponds, respectively. In general, Peruvian aquaculture is characterised by low technological intensity practices. Use of commercial aquafeeds is widespread, but artisanal feeds are frequently used in certain small-scale farms. We found that trout feeds feature higher environmental burdens than do black pacu and tilapia feeds. A similar trend is observed for production of these species. Across species, the substitution of artisanal with commercial feeds, despite improving feed conversion ratios in all cases, does not always reduce overall environmental impacts. This is due to the additional energy use and transportation requirements associated with commercial feed inputs. The substitution of artisanal feeds with commercial ones generally increases environmental impacts of the fish farming systems for the specific feeds considered, despite enhanced FCRs and economies of scale. This is due to the higher environmental impacts associated to certain feed inputs used in commercial feeds, in particular highly refined feed inputs. Consequently, in light of the importance of feeds to overall life cycle impacts of aquaculture production, the Peruvian aquafeed industry should preferentially source less refined and, in general, less environmentally burdened feed inputs (e. g. Bolivian soybean products over Brazilian, high quality over lower quality fishmeal, avoiding protein concentrates, etc.), to the extent that fish farming performance (i.e. feed conversion efficiency and cost structure) is not strongly affected. Among species, black pacu aquaculture shows the best environmental performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This conversion process becomes obvious in the upper Rio das Mortes macro-catchment. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of future land use changes on the discharge dynamics of the Rio das Mortes River. A single catchment approach was applied with the physically-based water balance simulation model WaSiM 8.5.0 (Schulla and Jaspeper 2007) to simulate land use scenarios. In Scenario 1, only small pasture sites (< 1 km(2)) were converted into the respective land use type surrounding them (i.e. cropland or Cerrado vegetation), whereas in Scenario 2 all pasture sites were converted into cropland and all Cerrado patches were then transformed into pastures. The WaSiM model was calibrated and validated based on discharge data measured at two gauging stations, achieving Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.81 (calibration) and 0.68 (validation). Main problems in modelling arise because of scarce spatial distributed data on subsurface parameter and vegetation parameter (Cerrado biome). Therefore, the use of the numerical groundwater model and manifold calibration runs were essential in this modelling approach to allow the simulation of the high levels of baseflow during the dry season and the transition from the dry to the wet season. The immediate rise of the baseflow in response to the increasing precipitation at beginning of the rainy season is a result of high soil hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recharge. These soil characteristics apparently persist on newly-created pasture and cropland sites, which still exhibit high ksat values after deforestation. Simulated evapotranspiration is comparable to literature values (Eddy flux measurements, MODIS-EVI calculation) and recently done paired micro-catchment studies in this catchment. The scenario analysis indicates that there are only small differences in runoff volume, which is directly related to the precipitation changes. In the scenario 2, groundwater recharge and base flow increase, whereas surface runoff does not. Therefore, the ongoing land use intensification with pasture conversion to cropland, remaining high infiltration and slight increase of evapotranspiration may not change runoff volume and discharge characteristics.","[Meister, Sarina; Nobrega, Rodolfo L.

We compare two simulations of high and low emissions of biomass burning aerosol based on realistic interannual variability. The aerosol scheme in the model has hygroscopic growth and optical properties for BBA informed by recent observations, including those from the recent South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) intensive aircraft observations made during September 2012. We find that the difference in the September (peak biomass emissions month) BBA optical depth between a simulation with high emissions and a simulation with low emissions corresponds well to the difference in the BBA emissions between the two simulations, with a 71.6% reduction from high to low emissions for both the BBA emissions and the BB AOD in the region with maximum emissions (defined by a box of extent 5-25 degrees S, 40-70 degrees W, used for calculating mean values given below). The cloud cover at all altitudes in the region of greatest BBA difference is reduced as a result of the semi-direct effect, by heating of the atmosphere by the BBA and changes in the atmospheric stability and surface fluxes. Within the BBA layer the cloud is reduced by burnoff, while the higher cloud changes appear to be responding to stability changes. The boundary layer is reduced in height and stabilized by increased BBA, resulting in reduced deep convection and reduced cloud cover at heights of 914 km, above the layer of BBA. Despite the decrease in cloud fraction, September downwelling clear-sky and all-sky shortwave radiation at the surface is reduced for higher emissions by 13.77 +/- 0.39 W m(-2) (clear-sky) and 7.37 +/- 2.29 W m(-2) (all-sky), whilst the upwelling shortwave radiation at the top of atmosphere is increased in clear sky by 3.32 +/- 0.09 W m(-2), but decreased by -1.36 +/- 1.67 W m(-2) when cloud changes are included. Shortwave heating rates increase in the aerosol layer by 18% in the high emissions case. The mean surface temperature is reduced by 0.14 +/- 0.24 degrees C and mean precipitation is reduced by 14.5% in the peak biomass region due to both changes in cloud cover and cloud microphysical properties. If the increase in BBA occurs in a particularly dry year, the resulting reduction in precipitation may exacerbate the drought. The position of the South Atlantic high pressure is slightly altered by the presence of increased BBA, and the strength of the southward low-level jet to the east of the Andes is increased. There is some evidence that some impacts of increased BBA persist through the transition into the monsoon, particularly in precipitation, but the differences are only statistically significant in some small regions in November. This study therefore provides an insight into how variability in deforestation, realized through variability in biomass burning emissions, may contribute to the South American climate, and consequently on the possible impacts of future changes in BBA emissions.","[Thornhill, Gillian D.; Ryder, Claire L.; Highwood, Eleanor J.; Shaffrey, Len C.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Johnson, Ben T.] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Shaffrey, Len C.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England",,"Thornhill, GD (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.",g.thornhill@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,35,,,,,,,,,,,APR 19,2018.0,18,8,,,,5321,5342,,10.5194/acp-18-5321-2018,,,,,,,,WOS:000430424600003,

Using an adjusted von Thunen model to explain land user behavior in relation to different variables, considering a general forest transition curve and looking at a potential relation between governance and deforestation rates, the authors conclude that reduction of deforestation and forest degradation can only be achieved by a combined approach of increasing forest rent relative to other land uses and reducing transaction costs for forest management and conservation. More than providing an additional income for a privileged few, REDD+ will need to address the barriers that have been identified in RFM over the past 30 years of investment in forest management and conservation.

Globally, at least 25 million kilometres of new roads are anticipated by 2050; a 60% increase in the total length of roads over that in 2010. Nine-tenths of all road construction is expected to occur in developing nations(1), including many regions that sustain exceptional biodiversity and vital ecosystem services. Roads penetrating into wilderness or frontier areas are a major proximate driver of habitat loss and fragmentation, wildfires, overhunting and other environmental degradation, often with irreversible impacts on ecosystems'. Unfortunately, much road proliferation is chaotic or poorly planned(3,4,6), and the rate of expansion is so great that it often overwhelms the capacity of environmental planners and managers(2-7). Here we present a global scheme for prioritizing road building. This large-scale zoning plan seeks to limit the environmental costs of road expansion while maximizing its benefits for human development, by helping to increase agricultural production, which is an urgent priority given that global food demand could double by mid-century(8,9). Our analysis identifies areas with high environmental values where future road building should be avoided if possible, areas where strategic road improvements could promote agricultural development with relatively modest environmental costs, and 'conflict areas' where road building could have sizeable benefits for agriculture but with serious environmental damage. Our plan provides a template for proactively zoning and prioritizing roads during the most explosive era of road expansion in human history.","[Laurance, William F.; Clements, Gopalasamy Reuben; Sloan, Sean; Goosem, Miriam; Venter, Oscar] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Laurance, William F.; Clements, Gopalasamy Reuben; Sloan, Sean; Goosem, Miriam; Venter, Oscar] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Clements, Gopalasamy Reuben] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Kenyir Res Inst, Kuala Terengganu 21030, Malaysia; [O'Connell, Christine S.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [O'Connell, Christine S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Mueller, Nathan D.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Environm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Edwards, David P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Phalan, Ben; Balmford, Andrew] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Van Der Ree, Rodney] Australian Res Ctr Urban Ecol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Van Der Ree, Rodney] Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Arrea, Irene Burgues] Conservat Strategy Fund, San Jose, Costa Rica",,"Laurance, WF (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia.",bill.laurance@jcu.edu.au,,,,,,,417,433,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 11,2014.0,513,7517,,,,229,+,,10.1038/nature13717,,,,,,,,WOS:000341362800049,

Understanding this activity is important in regional atmospheric CH4 budgets given that these ecosystems account for substantial portions of the landscape in mountainous areas like the Andes. We investigated the drivers of net CH4 fluxes from premontane, lower and upper montane forests, experiencing a seasonal climate, in south-eastern Peru. Between February 2011 and June 2013, these soils all functioned as net sinks for atmospheric CH4. Mean (standard error) net CH4 fluxes for the dry and wet season were -1.6 (0.1) and -1.1 (0.1) mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) in the upper montane forest, -1.1 (0.1) and -1.0 (0.1) mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) in the lower montane forest, and -0.2 (0.1) and -0.1 (0.1) mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) in the premontane forest. Seasonality in CH4 exchange varied among forest types with increased dry season CH4 uptake only apparent in the upper montane forest. Variation across these forests was best explained by available nitrate and water-filled pore space indicating that nitrate inhibition of oxidation or diffusional constraints imposed by changes in water-filled pore space on methanotrophic communities may represent important controls on soil-atmosphere CH4 exchange. Net CH4 flux was inversely related to elevation; a pattern that differs to that observed in Ecuador, the only other extant study site of soil-atmosphere CH4 exchange in the tropical Andes. This may result from differences in rainfall patterns between the regions, suggesting that attention should be paid to the role of rainfall and soil moisture dynamics in modulating CH4 uptake by the organic-rich soils typical of high-elevation tropical forests.","[Jones, Sam P.; Reay, Dave S.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Diem, Torsten; Teh, Yit Arn] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Quispe, Lidia P.

We present a larger dataset for gender from iris, and evaluate gender prediction accuracy using linear SVM and CNN, comparing hand-crafted and deep features. We use probabilistic occlusion masking to gain insight on the problem.

The available data in the literature suggest, however, that the effect of silvicultural treatments on tree growth is smaller in dry forests than in humid forest tree species. In this study, we analyze the effect of logging and application of additional silvicultural treatments (liana cutting and girdling of competing trees) on the growth rates of future crop trees (FCTs; i.e., trees of current and potentially commercial timber species with adequate form and apparent growth potential). The study was carried out in a tropical dry forest in Bolivia where a set of 21.25-ha plots were monitored for 4 years post-logging. Plots received one of four treatments that varied in intensity of both logging and silvicultural treatments as follows: normal (reduced-impact) logging; normal logging and low-intensity silviculture; increased logging intensity and high-intensity silviculture; and, unlogged controls. The silvicultural treatments applied to FCTs involved liberation from lianas and overtopping trees. Results showed that rates of FCT stem diameter growth increased with light availability, logging intensity, and intensity of silvicultural treatments, and decrease with liana infestation degree. Growth rate increment was larger in the light and intensive silvicultural treatment (22-27%). Long-lived pioneer species showed the strongest response to intensive silviculture (50% increase) followed by total shade-tolerant species (24%) and partial shade-tolerant species (10%). While reduced-impact logging is often not sufficient to guarantee the sustainability of timber yields, application of silvicultural treatments that substantially enhanced the growth rates of FCTs will help move the management of these forests closer to the goal of sustained yield.

In the humid tropics like the Amazonia biome, carbon inputs from agrosystems are rarely quantified and described, despite their major contribution to the SOC dynamics after deforestation. We assessed SOC dynamics with repeated measurements in the layer 0-30 cm until five years after deforestation in a diachronic site in French Guiana, cleared with a fire-free method associated to large woody debris inputs. Three agrosystems were studied: one year maize/soybean rotation with disk tillage (DT) and without tillage (NT), and a mowed grassland (G). Aboveground carbon inputs from agrosystems were measured. In addition to SOC stocks assessment, we measured roots carbon stocks, and performed delta C-13 measurements in grassland soil. We found a transient SOC stock increase until 1.5 years after deforestation because of large woody debris inputs from deforestation method, but these C inputs were rapidly mineralized and poorly contributed to SOC stocks 5 years after deforestation. SOC stocks in grassland did not differ from forest despite large hay exports. Thanks to large root-derived carbon inputs, C4-SOC stock in grassland was 10.4 t ha(-1) 5 years after deforestation (18.7% of the SOC stock). In annual crops, 5 years after deforestation, SOC stocks decreased on average by 18.6% compared to forest. SOC stocks did not differ according to soil tillage since aboveground carbon inputs were similar in DT and NT systems. Lower SOC stocks in annual crops compared to grassland is explained by lower carbon restitutions and by higher mineralization rate of organic matter.","[Fujisaki, Kenji; Perrin, Anne-Sophie; Garric, Bernard] Etab Publ Local Enseignement & Format Profess Agr, Terres Inovia, BP 53, Macouria 97355, French Guiana; [Fujisaki, Kenji; Brossard, Michel] IRD, UMR Eco & Sols, CIRAD, INRA,Montpellier SupAgro, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Balesdent, Jerome] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Coll France, INRA,IRD,CEREGE,Europole Arbois, BP80, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France",,"Fujisaki, K (corresponding author), IRD, UMR Eco &Sols, Campus SupAgro,Batiment 12,2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France.",kenji.fujisaki@ird.fr,,,,,,,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 1,2017.0,245,,,,,63,73,,10.1016/j.agee.2017.05.011,,,,,,,,WOS:000403988600007,

In order to adapt and transfer models across image acquisitions, one must be able to cope with datasets that are not co-registered, acquired under different illumination and atmospheric conditions, by different sensors, and with scarce ground references. Traditionally, methods based on histogram matching have been used. However, they fail when densities have very different shapes or when there is no corresponding band to be matched between the images. An alternative builds upon manifold alignment. Manifold alignment performs a multidimensional relative normalization of the data prior to product generation that can cope with data of different dimensionality (e.g. different number of bands) and possibly unpaired examples. Aligning data distributions is an appealing strategy, since it allows to provide data spaces that are more similar to each other, regardless of the subsequent use of the transformed data. In this paper, we study a methodology that aligns data from different domains in a nonlinear way through kernelization. We introduce the Kernel Manifold Alignment (KEMA) method, which provides a flexible and discriminative projection map, exploits only a few labeled samples (or semantic ties) in each domain, and reduces to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. We successfully test KEMA in multi-temporal and multi-source very high resolution classification tasks, as well as on the task of making a model invariant to shadowing for hyperspectral imaging.

The object-based approach created segments of images, and calculated statistical and textural attributes. Our results showed that estimation accuracy of the object-based approach, with the use of band 1 and an exponential fit, was the best (R (2) = 0.76), and this accuracy was comparable to that of the pixel-based approach (R (2) = 0.67). Although several textural variables were related to forest biomass, they did not contribute significantly to improvement of estimation accuracy. However, the object-based method can be used for image segmentation so that the image objects are spectrally more homogeneous within individual regions than with their neighbors. Hence, they can be regarded as management units for policy-related spatial decisions.

Genetic diversity can delimit information about gene flow and population differentiation in localities with malaria. Objective: To estimate the genetic diversity of An. triannulatus in five municipalities with high and low incidence of malaria in the department of Cordoba. Materials and methods: The entomological collections were done between August and November, 2016, in Tierralta, Puerto Libertador, Montelibano, Sahagun, and Planeta Rica. We used the CO/ barcoding fragment as molecular marker. The genetic analysis included the estimation of genetic parameters such as the diversity haplotype, the genetic structure, the gene flow, the Tajima's D test, the haplotype network, and the phylogenetic relationship. Results: We obtained 148 sequences with a length of 655 nucleotides of the COI gene, from which we derived 44 haplotypes. The H2 and H21 haplotypes were the most frequent in the populations. The values of the Tajima's D test were negative and not significant (p>0.10). The genetic structure index (F-ST=0.01427) and the gene flow (Nm=17.27) evidenced no differentiation between sampled populations due to the high exchange of migrants. Using phylogenetic inferences and the haplotype network, we identified one single species without geographic differentiation or lineages in the geographic range studied.

All trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh were permanently tagged with sequentially numbered aluminium tags and their girth measured. 148 tree species (in 120 genera and 49 families) were enumerated in a total sample of 13,393 individuals. Species diversity, density and dispersion patterns were determined. The mean species richness, density and basal area per hectare were 65 species, 446 stems and 36.26 m(2) respectively. The Sorensen similarity index for thirty 1-ha subplots varied from 0.7 to 0.9, indicating the homogeneity in species composition of the stand. The pronounced species hierarchy has resulted in the dominance of four species that occupy four different forest storeys: Drypetes longifolia (lower storey) Reinwardtiodendron anamallayanum (middle storey), Poeciloneuron indicum (upper storey) and Dipterocarpus indicus (emergent). The forest was dominated by Euphorbiaceae in terms of richness (18 species) and abundance of species (3788 stems), and Dipterocarpaceae based on the contribution to basal area (18.4%). Species richness and density decreased with increasing girth-class. Girth class frequency of the stand exhibited an expanding population of trees. Twenty-nine tree species, analysed for spatial dispersion at 1-ha scale, exhibited both clumped and uniform patterns, except Vateria indica which was randomly distributed in one hectare. Repeat census scheduled for subsequent years, will elucidate the behaviour of the individual species and the population dynamics of the tree flora and will be useful for forest conservation and management.

We sampled total aboveground biomass (TAGB) at five distinct periods during the process of forest conversion to pasture. TAGB was measured after the primary forests were cut, after the initial forest slash fires, and 1 year after pasture establishment. After 2 years, TAGB was quantified before and after the first pasture fire conducted on site. To capture the variability in biomass burning, two treatments (Baja and Alta) based upon degree of biomass consumed were established in a randomized block design with three treatment blocks. Mean TAGB of the slashed primary forest was 118 Mg ha(-1) in the Baja plots and 135 Mg ha(-1) in the Alta plots. The slash fires resulted in biomass loss of 62% of the TAGB (75 Mg ha(-1)) in the Baja treatment and 80% (108 Mg ha(-1)) in the Alta treatment. The greatest treatment differences in consumption occurred in the large wood (>7.6 cm diameter). Fires in the Baja treatment consumed similar to31% of the large wood, but only 7% in the Alta treatment. Prior to the first pasture fire, TAGB was 40.3 Mg ha(-1) in the Baja treatment, and 20.9 Mg ha(-1) in the Alta treatment. The pasture fires consumed 63% of the TAGB in the Baja sites and 75% of the TAGB in the Alta treatment. Following the pasture fires, the TAGB was 14.8 Mg ha(-1) in the Baja treatment and 7.6 Mg ha(-1) in the Alta treatment. In the first 2 years of land cover change from dry forest to pasture there was a dramatic decline in TAGB (and hence aboveground C pools) totaling 87 and 94% of that of pre-disturbance forests. The total biomass lost via fire and decomposition was 113 and 132 Mg ha(-1); fire accounted for 89-92% of the loss while decomposition/disappearance comprised 2-11% of the total biomass loss. The widespread distribution of tropical dry forests, their high rates of deforestation, and their high rates of biomass consumption during fires suggest that they are significant anthropogenic sources of atmospheric C. The dramatic loss of biomass and associated high degree of fire severity may also affect future site productivity and the capacity for these sites to function as C pools in the future.

The role of karst ecosystems in the global carbon cycle remains unclear, due to the lack of an appropriate method for determining the thickness of the solum, a representative sampling of the soil and data of organic carbon stocks at the ecosystem level. The karst region in southwestern China is the largest in the world. In this study, we estimated biomass, soil quantity and ecosystem organic carbon stocks in four vegetation types typical of karst ecosystems in this region, shrub grasslands (SG), thorn shrubbery (TS), forest - shrub transition (FS) and secondary forest (F). The results showed that the biomass of SG, TS, FS, and F is 0.52, 0.85, 5.9 and 19.2 kg m(-2), respectively and the corresponding organic cabon storage is 0.26, 0.40, 2.83 and 9.09 kg m(-2), respectively. Nevertheless, soil quantity and corresponding organic carbon storage are very small in karst habitats. The quantity of fine earth overlaying the physical weathering zone of the carbonate rock of SG, TS, FS and F is 38.10, 99.24, 29.57 and 61.89 kg m(-2), respectively, while the corresponding organic carbon storage is only 3.34, 4.10, 2.37, 5.25 kg m(-2), respectively. As a whole, ecosystem organic carbon storage of SG, TS, FS, and F is 3.81, 4.72, 5.68 and 15.1 kg m(-2), respectively. These are very low levels compared to other ecosystems in non-karst areas. With the restoration of degraded vegetation, karst ecosystems in southwestern China may play active roles in mitigating the increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.","[Liu, Yuguo; Liu, Changcheng; Guo, Ke; Yang, Jun; Zhang, Xinshi; Li, Guoqing] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yuguo; Li, Guoqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shijie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Guiyang, Peoples R China",,"Guo, K (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, Beijing, Peoples R China.",guoke@ibcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,15,26,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 25,2013.0,8,2,,,,,,e56443,10.1371/journal.pone.0056443,,,,,,,,WOS:000316849500015,

This forest-centred approach considers the people who inhabit the frontier as agents of land use change and forest conversion focusing on how their actions affect forest cover. Welfare indicators for forest frontier populations (income, education, health, access to basic services) are addressed only incidentally in terms of how they influence land use. 'People' centred research, which asks questions from the perspective of human welfare such as, 'Are frontier settlers better off than they were before?' or 'What kind of socio-economic impacts does frontier life have on the people who live there? and How can their lives be improved?, has been less common. As a result, we know much about the impacts, especially adverse impacts, which settler activity on the frontier has on forest cover but little about the impacts settlement has on settlers, themselves. This paper attempts to shift discussion towards these kinds of questions and a more people centred approach by reviewing existing research that directly addresses the welfare of settlers in tropical forest frontiers in Latin America. We also review research that touches on settler welfare by considering the concept of 'sustainability' on the forest frontier and stakes out a comprise position between 'forest' and 'people' centred questions or concerns. Settler welfare is defined primarily in economic terms. Household income, wealth, and agricultural productivity are interpreted a proxies for welfare in most cases. We also consider welfare in terms of access to basic services (health and education) and living conditions. We particularly consider how settler welfare indicators may change over time on the frontier. Tropical forests, defined as tropical, moist, broadleaf forests, are the main ecological setting of interest. These forests are generally the largest unoccupied areas in many Latin American countries and are thus, also the main 'agricultural frontier' or areas of new settlement by small farmers.","Univ Costa Rica, CCP, San Jose 2060, Costa Rica",,"Marquette, CM (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, CCP, San Jose 2060, Costa Rica.",cmarquette223@hotmail.com,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,MAY-JUL,2006.0,27,5-6,,,,397,444,,10.1007/s11111-006-0029-y,,,,,,,,WOS:000242634000002,

We assessed the ability of rainforest plant species to persist through fire via resprouting. Natural rates of mortality and resprouting in unburnt areas were assessed for all saplings (stems < 2 m) via 13, 2 x 50 m belt transects, and compared to estimates of mortality and resprouting in 26 transects in burnt areas. We also tested the resprouting ability per-individual stem of each species against all other stems with which it co-occurred. Totals of 1242 stems (138 species) were sampled in burnt transects and 503 stems (95 species) in unburnt transects (total number of unique species = 169). There was no difference in the number of stems existing prior to the fire in burnt and unburnt areas when expressed on a per-sample area basis. Resprouting from basal shoots and root suckers was significantly greater in burnt than in unburnt areas, but rates of stem sprouting were not different. In burnt areas 72 species were tested for resprouting ability and most (65/72) resprouted at similar rates. All species analysed contained individuals that resprouted. The resprouting response of five species was significantly lower, and in two species was significantly higher. For these species especially, fire may act as a mechanism altering relative abundances. The fire coincided with an extreme El Nino event. Current predictions indicate El Nino conditions may become increasingly common, suggesting fire events within rainforest could become more frequent. Resprouting as a general phenomenon of rainforest species, and differential resprouting ability between species should therefore be an important consideration in assessing the potential path of vegetation change in rainforests after fire.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Cairns 4870, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Cairns 4870, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Trop Savannas Cooperat Res Ctr, Cairns 4870, Australia",,"Marrinan, MJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Cairns 4870, Australia.",matthew.marrinan@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,25,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2005.0,30,8,,,,817,826,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01513.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000233411000001,

We address this issue during the transition from late summer to autumn cooling in a small temperate lake by combining micrometeorology, physical limnology, and carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements throughout the water column. Over the 26-day campaign, the lake cooled and emitted CO2 with daily average loss of 23 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1). Over diel cycles, lake surface pCO(2) decreased during daytime heating and increased during nighttime cooling, while daytime CO2 fluxes exceeded nighttime fluxes by 35% due to higher daytime wind speeds. We compared the effects of diel and synoptic weather patterns on the CO2 distribution within the lake and lake-atmosphere CO2 flux. Increases in near-surface pCO(2) scaled with stratification and heat loss which moderated transport of dissolved gases into the mixed layer. When winds were above similar to 4 m s(-1), lake-scale circulations drove upwelling and downwelling that redistributed heat and carbon dioxide between the northeast and southwest basins. Short-burst peak CO2 fluxes exceeded 50 mmol m(-2) d(-1) during windy periods associated with storms. However, the seasonal cooling-induced transition to persistent deep mixing led to the highest CO2 concentrations in the mixed layer and at the surface and the highest sustained CO2 fluxes (approaching 100 mmol m(-2) d(-1)).","[Czikowsky, Matthew J.; Miller, Scott D.] SUNY Albany, Atmospher Sci Res Ctr, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Maclntyre, Sally; Tedford, Edmund W.; Vidal, Javier] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Maclntyre, Sally] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Miller, SD (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Atmospher Sci Res Ctr, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",smiller@albany.edu,,,,,,,17,19,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2018.0,123,8,,,,2305,2322,,10.1029/2017JG004209,,,,,,,,WOS:000445731100001,

This paper presents a multitemporal phenological frequency analysis over a relatively short period (MTPFA-SP) methodology to detect vegetation changes. This MTPFA-SP methodology bases on the amplitude components of fast Fourier transforming (FFT) and is implemented with two steps. First, NDVI time series over two periods are transformed with FFT into frequency domain, separately. Second, amplitude components with phenological information from Step 1 are selected for further change comparison. In this methodology, component selection shows physical meanings of natural vegetation process in frequency domain. Comparisons among those selected components help enhance the ability to rapidly detect vegetation changes. To validate this MTPFA-SP methodology, we detect changes between two periods (2001-2005 and 2006-2010) in the eastern Tibet Plateau area and make two kinds of assessments.

This paper reviews results already published elsewhere and presents additional data on Hg dynamics in the LVGF. Studies conducted at the Mugusu and Rwamagaza artisanal mines indicated different degrees of Hg contamination and dispersion in environmental matrices. Mercury concentration in contaminated river sediments near the Mugusu mine varied from 6.0 to 0.5mg/kg on a dry weight basis. The highest Hg contamination levels (165-232mg/kg) were associated with mine tailings at the Rwamagaza mine. Mercury concentrations in fish representing different dietary habits on the southwestern shore of Lake Victoria at the Nungwe Bay were very low (2-35 mu g/kg) and thought to represent background levels. These and other results suggested that the use of Hg in gold extraction in the LVGF has not caused high Hg levels in lake fish. The study of Hg in lichens showed Parmelia lichen to be an effective bioindicator for atmospheric Hg contamination due to Hg emissions from gold-amalgam firing and purification operations. The Hg levels in the lichens around the Mugusu mine ranged from 3.1 to 0.1 mu g/g; the highest levels were recorded in the lichens sampled close to gold-amalgam processing sites. The regional background level in the Parmelia lichen was 0.05-0. 10 mu g/g, with a mean level of 0.07 mu g/g. which indicated that oxidation and methylation of metallic Hg in the tailings occurred at significant levels under tropical conditions. Re-equilibration of the tailings with freshwater (FW) indicated the MeHg was firmly bound in the tailings and therefore very little MeHg was released to the water column (0.2-1.5 ng/L). The methylation of Hg in tropical loamy clay soil contaminated with HgCl2 (5 mg Hg/kg) yielded MeHg concentrations of 11 and 14 ng/g when inundated with seawater and FW, respectively, for 4 weeks. Little MeHg was transferred from the soil to the equilibrated water (<= 0.4 ng/L). Atmospheric exposure of the soil pre-inundated with FW resulted in net degradation of MeHg during the 1 st week of exposure, followed by net production and accumulation of MeHg in the soil (up to 15.5 ng/g) during atmospheric desiccation. Mercury uptake by fish from the Hg-0-contaminated aquatic sediment tailings system in the aquarium experiment was found to be low, suggesting the low availability of MeHg for bioaccumulation in the system. These and other results provide useful insights into Hg transformation, mobility and bioavailability in tropical aquatic systems affected by Hg pollution from gold mining operations.

First, it assesses and compares the local impact on forest condition of labor-intensive and capital-intensive commercial logging. Second, it assesses the regional significance and permanency of these changes. Studies of land-cover change associated with commercial logging have focused almost exclusively on capital-intensive extraction and have assumed that after logging, degraded forests are transformed into agricultural cover. This study shows that both capital- and labor-intensive logging result in similar land-cover changes (i.e., forest degradation) if the timber sought is the same. However, labor-intensive loggers also seek timber species not sought by capital-intensive loggers, and this impact is statistically different from the impact of the extraction of the first group of species. Results also show that only a small fraction (20-30 percent) of the area logged is later converted to agricultural cover types. The persistence of logged forests means that up to 20 percent of the remaining forest cover could correspond to forests with significant and lasting levels of degradation. Furthermore, the different production requirements for each group of species also mean that there is a spatial differentiation in the impact of logging in the region. Logged forests are arranged into two consecutive corridors on each side of access routes (e.g., rivers). The first corridor corresponds to a narrow (approximately 1-km) band of high-intensity degradation. The second, broader (approximately 2-km) forest band, with lower levels of degradation, extends inland along first-tier corridors. A key factor determining the permanency of this land-cover pattern is the strong control local communities have over the land in the region. This limits the spread of patterns observed in other frontier areas, especially the conversion of logged forests into agricultural cover.","Univ Texas, Dept Geog, Ctr Environm Studies Latin Amer, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Sierra, R (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Dept Geog, Ctr Environm Studies Latin Amer, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",rsierra@mail.utexas.edu; miltontirado@hotmail.com; wpalacios@proyectocaiman.org,,,,,,,8,10,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2003.0,55,4,,,,477,490,,10.1111/0033-0124.5504006,,,,,,,,WOS:000186231200006,

The technique models remotely measured spectra as linear combinations of pure spectra, called endmembers, while allowing the types and number of endmembers to vary on a per pixel basis. In this manner, vegetation is characterized by a unique set of endmembers as well as by the fractions. Reference endmembers were selected from a library of field and laboratory measured spectra of leaves, canopies, nonphotosynthetic materials (e.g., stems), and soils and used to develop a series of candidate models. Each candidate model was applied to the image, then, on a per pixel basis, assessed in terms of fractions, root mean squared (RMS) error, and residuals. If a model met all criteria, it was listed as a candidate for that pixel. For this study, selection criteria included fractions between -0.01 and 1.01, an RMS less than 0.025 and a residual less than 0.025 in seven or more contiguous bands. A total of 889 two-endmember models were evaluated and used to generate 276 three-endmember models. To facilitate model selection from a large pool of candidates, an optimal set was selected to provide maximal areal coverage. A total of 24 two-endmember and 12 three-endmember models were chosen. These models were used to generate fraction images and vegetation maps showing evergreen and drought deciduous or senesced vegetation. We found that a majority of the image could be modeled as two-endmember models. Three-endmember models provided greater areal coverage, yet provided poorer vegetation discrimination due to an increase in model overlap (two or more model candidates modeling the same pixel). The vegetation maps demonstrate that the technique is capable of discriminating a large number of spectrally distinct types of vegetation while capturing the mosaic-like spatial distribution typical of chaparral. However, additional research is required to fully evaluate the technique and validate the vegetation maps that were produced.

While a definition of forest that is globally acceptable and appropriate for monitoring using standard remote sensing options will necessarily be based on a small set of easily measured parameters, there are dangers when simple definitions are applied locally. At the very least, we recommend that natural forest be differentiated from plantations and that for defining forest the lower height limit defining trees be set at more than 5 m tall with the minimum cover of trees be set at more than 40%. These changes will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from what is now termed forest degradation without increasing monitoring costs. Furthermore, these minor changes in the definition of forest will promote the switch from degradation to responsible forest management, which will help mitigate global warming while protecting biodiversity and contributing to sustainable development.","[Sasaki, Nophea] Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA; [Sasaki, Nophea] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Appl Informat, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Putz, Francis E.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Sasaki, N (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, 324 N Main St, Petersham, MA 01366 USA.",nsasaki@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,192,198,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2009.0,2,5,,,,226,232,,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2009.00067.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000279223700004,

Recent studies suggest that once tree height is accounted for in biomass calculations, in addition to diameter and wood density, carbon stock estimates are reduced in many areas. However, it is possible that larger crown sizes might offset the reduction in biomass estimates in some forests where tree heights are lower because even comparatively short trees develop large, well-lit crowns in or above the forest canopy. While current allometric models and theory focus on diameter, wood density, and height, the influence of crown size and structure has not been well studied. To test the extent to which accounting for crown parameters can improve biomass estimates, we harvested and weighed 51 trees (11-169 cm diameter) in southwestern Amazonia where no direct biomass measurements have been made. The trees in our study had nearly half of total aboveground biomass in the branches (44% +/- 2% [mean +/- SE]), demonstrating the importance of accounting for tree crowns. Consistent with our predictions, key pantropical equations that include height, but do not account for crown dimensions, underestimated the sum total biomass of all 51 trees by 11% to 14%, primarily due to substantial underestimates of many of the largest trees. In our models, including crown radius greatly improves performance and reduces error, especially for the largest trees. In addition, over the full data set, crown radius explained more variation in aboveground biomass (10.5%) than height (6.0%). Crown form is also important: Trees with a monopodial architectural type are estimated to have 21-44% less mass than trees with other growth patterns. Our analysis suggests that accounting for crown allometry would substantially improve the accuracy of tropical estimates of tree biomass and its distribution in primary and degraded forests.","[Goodman, Rosa C.; Phillips, Oliver L.; Baker, Timothy R.] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",,"Goodman, RC (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",rosa.goodman@gmail.com,,,,,,,126,129,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2014.0,24,4,,,,680,698,,10.1890/13-0070.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000337117400007,

Geographical range size, human population density and latitude were the most consistently significant predictors of extinction risk, but otherwise there was little evidence for general, prescriptive indicators of high extinction risk across mammals.

However, if stakeholders do not perceive the benefit sharing as fair, the legitimacy of REDD+, and support for the mechanism, will be weakened. In this paper, drawing on data from CIFOR's Global Comparative Study on REDD+, we analyze national policy processes in 6 countries and incipient benefit-sharing arrangements in 21 REDD+ project sites. Through our analysis of current practices and debates, we identify six rationales that have been put forward to justify how benefits should be distributed and to whom. These rationales encompass a range of perspectives. Some hold that benefit sharing should be related to actual carbon emission reductions or to costs incurred in achieving the reduction of emissions; others emphasize the importance of a legal right to benefit, the need to consider aspects such as poverty reduction or the appropriateness of rewarding those with a history of protecting the forest. Each rationale has implications for the design of benefit-sharing mechanisms and the equity of their outcomes. We point out that, given the wide range of rationales and interests at play, the objectives of REDD+ and benefit sharing must be clearly established and the term benefit defined before effective benefit-sharing mechanisms can be designed. For stakeholders to support REDD+, the legitimacy of decision-making institutions, consideration of context, and attention to process are critical. Building legitimacy requires attention not only to fair distributional outcomes but also to consensus on relevant institutions' authority to make decisions and to procedural equity.","[Angelsen, Arild] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Trondheim, Norway",,,,,,,,,,104,106,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,18,4,,,,,,52,10.5751/ES-05834-180452,,,,,,,,WOS:000329431700052,

In such projects, establishing a suitable management model is a key issue for ensuring sustainability.

They may also differ with regard to sensitive features, such as the systems' ownership, level of users' participation, responsibility for the systems' operation and maintenance, the users' involvement in system installation processes and the administration of tariff payments. The existing literature lacks a comparative study highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each kind of management model and their contribution to achieving technical, economic, social, organisational and environmental sustainability. To fill this gap, this study analyses and compares the impact of different management models through a number of case studies in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia after 4 years of onsite work. Finally, general recommendations are given as results to strengthen all sustainability dimensions: among them, running comprehensive training programs to enhance local maintenance capabilities; reaching agreement with final electricity users to set a fair and affordable tariff rate and encouraging the involvement and self-organisation of the population to increase the sense of ownership.

Many countries, however, do not administer primaquine due to fear of hemolysis in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In other settings, primaquine is given without G6PD testing, putting patients at risk of hemolysis. New rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer the opportunity to screen for G6PD deficiency prior to treatment with primaquine. Here we assessed the cost-effectiveness of using G6PD RDTs on the Thailand-Myanmar border and provide the model as an online tool for use in other settings. Methods/Principal findings Decision tree models for the management of P. vivax malaria evaluated the costs and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with recurrences and primaquine-induced hemolysis from a health care provider perspective. Screening with G6PD RDTs before primaquine use was compared to (1) giving chloroquine alone and (2) giving primaquine without screening. Data were taken from a recent study on the impact of primaquine on P. vivax recurrences and a literature review. Compared to the use of chloroquine alone, the screening strategy had similar costs while averting 0.026 and 0.024 DALYs per primary infection in males and females respectively. Compared to primaquine administered without screening, the screening strategy provided modest cost savings while averting 0.011 and 0.004 DALYs in males and females respectively. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses resulted in a greater than 75% certainty that the screening strategy was cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of US$500, which is well below the common benchmark of per capita gross domestic product for Myanmar. Conclusions/Significance In this setting G6PD RDTs could avert DALYs by reducing recurrences and reducing hemolytic risk in G6PD deficient patients at low costs or cost savings. The model results are limited by the paucity of data available in the literature for some parameter values, including the mortality rates for both primaquine-induced hemolysis and P. vivax. The online model provides an opportunity to use different parameter estimates to examine the validity of these findings in other settings.","[Devine, Angela; Lubell, Yoel] Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand; [Devine, Angela; Chu, Cindy S.; Bancone, Germana; Nosten, Francois; Price, Ric N.; Lubell, Yoel] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford, England; [Parmiter, Minnie] Univ Glasgow, Boyd Orr Ctr, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Chu, Cindy S.; Bancone, Germana; Nosten, Francois] Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Shoklo Malaria Res Unit, Mae Sot, Thailand; [Price, Ric N.] Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Global & Trop Hlth Div, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Price, Ric N.] Charles Darwin Univ, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Yeung, Shunmay] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Infect & Trop Dis, London, England",,"Devine, A (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand.; Devine, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford, England.",angela@tropmedres.ac,,,,,,,11,12,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2017.0,11.0,5,,,,,,e0005602,10.1371/journal.pntd.0005602,,,,,,,,WOS:000402927300048,

Summed over 19 years, areas potentially influenced by major ecosystem disturbances (one FPAR-LO event over the period 1982-2000) total to more than 766,000 km(2). The periods of highest detection frequency were 1987-1989, 1995-1997, and 1999. Sub-continental regions of the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and Central Canada had the highest proportion (> 90%) of FPAR-LO pixels detected in forests, tundra shrublands, and wetland areas. The Great Lakes region showed the highest proportion (39%) of FPAR-LO pixels detected in cropland areas, whereas the western United States showed the highest proportion (16%) of FPAR-LO pixels detected in grassland areas. Based on this analysis, an historical picture is emerging of periodic droughts and heat waves, possibly coupled with herbivorous insect outbreaks, as among the most important causes of ecosystem disturbance in North America.","NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55415 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Seaside, CA 93955 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,"Potter, C (corresponding author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",cpotter@mail.arc.nasa.gov,,,,,,,32,34,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2005.0,8.0,7,,,,808,824,,10.1007/s10021-005-0041-6,,,,,,,,WOS:000233326500006,

As Mexico's last tropical forest frontier, the southern Yucatan peninsular region witnesses these tensions, giving rise to a hot spot of tropical deforestation. These forests register the imprint of ancient Maya uses and selective logging in the recent past, but significant modern conversion of them for agriculture began in the 1960s. Subsequently, as much as 10% of the region's forests have been disturbed anthropogenically. The precise rates of conversion and length of successional growth in both upland and wetland forests are tied to policy and political economic conditions. Pressures on upland forests are exacerbated by the development of infrastructure for El Mundo Maya, an archaeological and ecological activity predicated on forest maintenance, and by increased subsistence and market cultivation, including lands on the edge of Mexico's largest tropical forest biosphere reserve. In this complex setting, the southern Yucatan peninsular region project seeks to unite research in the ecological, social, and remote sensing sciences to provide a firm understanding of the dynamics of deforestation and to work towards spatially explicit assessments and models that can be used to monitor and project forest change under different assumptions.

A seasonal model is typically used to account for seasonality, but fitting a seasonal model is difficult when there are not enough data in the time series. Here, we propose a new approach that reduces seasonality in satellite image time series using spatial context. With this spatial context approach, each pixel value in the image is spatially normalised using the median value calculated from neighbouring pixels whose pixel values are above the 90th percentile. Using Landsat data, we compared our spatial context approach to a seasonal model approach at a humid tropical forest in Brazil and a thy tropical forest with strong seasonality in Bolivia. After reducing seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation from the same data using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) method. We show that, in dry tropical forest, deforestation events are detected much earlier when the spatial context approach is used to reduce seasonal variations in Landsat data than when a seasonal model is used. In the dry tropical forest, the median temporal detection delay for deforestation from the spatial context approach was two observations, seven times shorter than the median temporal detection delay from the seasonal model approach (15 observations). In the humid tropical forest, the difference in the temporal detection delay between the spatial context and seasonal model approach was not significant. The differences in overall spatial accuracy between the spatial context and seasonal model were also not significant in both dry and humid tropical forests. The main benefit for using spatial context is early detection of deforestation events in forests with strong seasonality. Therefore, the spatial context approach we propose here provides opportunity to monitor deforestation events in dry tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While drivers of forest change occur at multiple scales, we examined forest change at the municipal and national scales integrated with global processes such as capital, commodity, and labor flows. We modeled multi-scale socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental drivers of local forest cover change. Consistent with LAC's global leadership in soy and beef exports, primarily to China, Russia, the US, and the EU, national-level beef and soy production were the primary land use drivers of decreased forest cover. National level gross domestic product (GDP), migrant worker remittances and foreign investment, along with municipal-level temperature and area, were also significantly related to reduced forest cover. This challenges forest transition frameworks, which theorize that rising GDP and intensified agricultural production should be increasingly associated with forest regrowth. Instead, LAC forest change was linked to local, national, and global demographic, dietary and economic transitions, resulting in massive net forest cover loss. This suggests an urgent need to reconcile forest conservation with mounting global demand for animal protein.","[Lopez-Carr, David] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Ryan, Sadie J.] Univ Florida, Dept Geog, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA; [Ryan, Sadie J.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA; [Ryan, Sadie J.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Agr Sci & Engn, Sch Life Sci, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Clark, Matthew L.] Sonoma State Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Geospatial Anal, Dept Geog Environm & Planning, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA",,"Lopez-Carr, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",davidlopezcarr@ucsb.edu; sjryan@ufl.edu; matthew.clark@sonoma.edu,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022.0,11.0,3,,,,,,326,10.3390/land11030326,,,,,,,,WOS:000775102800001,

The approach rests on the decomposition of intricate dynamics of Global Change into problematic patterns civilisation nature interactions ('syndromes') this is done by an iterative process of observations, data and theoretical system analysis and GIS-based modelling attempts. These syndromes of global change characterise endangering and risky developments of civilisation nature interaction and represent a baseline for measuring and indicating 'non-sustainability'; in order to have a sustainable development it is necessary to have a far-reaching absence of syndromes. They encompass the core problems of global change, e.g. soil degradation, climate change, threats to biodiversity or global deforestation. Patterns are defined as characteristic constellations of global change trends ('symptoms'). Cause-effect schemes of symptoms and their interrelations are constituted as complex phenomena resulting from interactions over the different spheres of the Earth system (biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, population, pedosphere, economy, psychosocial sphere, social organisation, science and technology). The approach is illustrated by an analysis of civilisation-nature interaction patterns relevant for global deforestation. Global forest ecosystems have been chosen for this investigation because of their important role in the global carbon cycle and their importance for biological diversity. The resulting geographical patchwork of the combined dispositions and intensities of the different syndromes describes current and future regional threats to forests by their underlying global cause-effect patterns of civilisation-nature interaction.

Fusion of panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) Quickbird satellite imagery was undertaken using four image fusion techniques: Brovey, hue-saturation-value (HSV), principal components (PC), and Gram-Schmidt (GS) spectral sharpening. These four fusion techniques were compared in terms of their mapping accuracy to a normal MS image using maximum-likelihood classification (MLC) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. Gram-Schmidt fusion technique yielded the highest overall accuracy and kappa value with both MLC (67.5% and 0.63, respectively) and SVM methods (73.3% and 0.68, respectively). This compared favorably with the accuracies achieved using the MS image. Overall, improvements of 4.1%, 3.6%, 5.8%, 5.4%, and 7.2% in overall accuracies were obtained in case of SVM over MLC for Brovey, HSV, GS, PC, and MS images, respectively. Visual and statistical analyses of the fused images showed that the Gram-Schmidt spectral sharpening technique preserved spectral quality much better than the principal component, Brovey, and HSV fused images.

We tested the genetic relatedness of parasites, using informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms and drug resistance loci. We found that parasites were clustered into 3 clonal subpopulations and were related to parasites from Colombia. Two clusters of Panamanian parasites shared identical drug resistance haplotypes, and all clusters shared a chloroquine-resistance genotype matching the pfcrt haplotype of Colombian origin.

Agricultural land has a positive association with marriage rates. As potential intervening mechanisms between agricultural land and marriage rates, I propose nonfamily organizations, school and work activities, and local marriage markets.

This debate is still crucial for present day Egypt, a country facing major challenges, including food security, agriculture modernization, employment generation, and land fragmentation due to dramatic population growth. In this context, policy makers are always seeking the best land allocation system for these new lands. This paper analyzes the land tenure and land use dynamics of farmers' settlements during a program of land reclamation (from 1960 to 2010) in the Western Desert of the Nile Delta. The objective is to describe the land development paths of farm settlement and to identify promising dynamics by cross-referencing the farmers' stories and their livelihood achievements. To accomplish that, we conducted household surveys and interviews to learn the life stories' of 175 family farms. Our study finds that, beyond the rules and institutions that fixed the land tenure regimes and its distribution in these new lands, settlers have found different ways to hold on and secure their land farm, even if the unequal land distribution still structure the population. The results highlight also the dynamism of small-scale settlers, regarding livelihood diversification, to face the challenges of these desert environments. In addition, the dual-purpose system embedded in mixed crop-livestock systems can contribute to settlers' livelihood security. These realities confound the unchanged rhetoric of government and this calls for more social consideration of these new rural spaces based on a combination of heterogeneous networks off relationships and knowledge. The apparent gap between the macro- and micro-perspectives analyses also requires multi-scale assessments. Finally, the life-story method proves to be a complementary and useful approach to integrate the livelihood representation and dynamic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential is rapidly growing for carbon markets to deliver private and public compensation for emissions reductions from forest protection at national and subnational scales. Nevertheless, monetization of forest ecosystem services remains scant, leaving forests vulnerable to conversion to other land uses in the short run. We develop a real options framework for a representative farmer's land-use decisions, identifying a value gap between private short-term incentives versus long-term benefits from carbon market compensation, given uncertainties over future values for emissions reductions from forest protection. A quantitative illustration of this framework for Mato Grosso, Brazil, demonstrates that forest conservation coupled with cattle ranching intensification is competitive with the predominant practice of extensive cattle production, but is hindered by landholders' perceptions of the relative option values to different land uses. We show how bonds, call and put options allow for early monetization of part of potential future carbon revenues, even under uncertainty, changing incentives at the landholder level and jumpstarting conservation and more efficient models of agricultural production.

Many tropical forests are exploited both commercially for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Divergences between these two uses may have significant implications for forest-dependent livelihoods. This article gathers existing examples of conflicts and complementarities between selective logging and non-timber uses of forest from the livelihood perspective. Additionally it draws on three case studies from Brazil. Cameroon and Indonesia to examine by what mechanisms, and to what extent, logging impacts forest resources of livelihood importance, as well as to consider how factors such as logging regime and forest management system may mediate such influences. By doing so we aim to shed further light on a relatively unacknowledged issue in tropical forest management and conservation. Four specific mechanisms were identified; conflict of use and the indirect impacts of logging being those most commonly implicated in negative effects on livelihood-relevant NTFPs. Eighty two percent of reviewed articles highlighted negative impacts on NTFP availability. Examples of positive impacts were restricted to light demanding species that respond to the opening of forest structure and typically represent a small subset of those of livelihood value. Despite considerable impacts on livelihoods, in all three case studies we found evidence to support the potential for enhanced compatibility between timber extraction and the subsistence use of NTFPs. Drawing on this evidence, and findings from our review, we make specific recommendations for research, policy and management implementation. These findings have significant implications for reconciling timber and non-timber uses of tropical forests. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Because there are numerous ecosystem services provided by mangroves, it is important to understand their adaptations and responses to these climatic events. In April 2004, Typhoon Sudal, a category 3-4 cyclone, passed over the state of Yap, Federated States of Micronesia. For four months following the typhoon we measured forest structure, above-ground biomass, tree mortality and response in six mangroves. The sites were dominated by species common in mangroves throughout the Indo-Pacific-Sonneratia alba, Brugueira gymnorrhiza, and Rhizophora apiculata. Total above-ground biomass (TAGB) of mangrove forests ranged from 211-573 Mg ha(-1). Tree mortality ranged from 6% to 32% among stands. Adaptations and responses to the typhoon varied by species, as well as by geographic location. Sonneratia alba had a higher frequency of mainstems broken (26%), but was the only species that vigorously sprouted from dormant basal or epicormic tissues. Standing live trees accounted for 80-95% of TAGB, suggesting that adaptations of mangrove trees can facilitate the persistence of an intact forest structure following typhoons of this intensity.

The model is unique in capturing the entire systems behavior affecting deforestation and degradation, approximated through changes in forest area and stand density. Thus the model incorporates biological factors, such as growth, the socio-economic factors and related interactions between them. A matrix growth sub-model for the woodlands, accounting for diameter increment, mortality, recruitment and harvest of trees, was imbedded in the overall model to account for the stock changes over the planning horizon. The socio-economic factors and relations affecting the woodland deforestation and degradation processes are addressed through incorporation of three sets of activities, namely, crop cultivation, livestock raising and wood harvesting for firewood and charcoal. Demand and supply relations for these activities are linked through behavioral, structural and accounting equations. The production, consumption, and sale decisions are assumed to be made simultaneously by the households. Though, the model can be successfully used at different levels and planning horizons, a village is the decision making unit over the period 2003-2020 for the purpose of this study. The net present value of cash flows is taken as a proxy measure for utility that is sought to be maximized under six alternate scenarios, including the base scenario. Under the base scenario, 46.7% woodland clearing for cultivation and 42.1% reduction in biomass density were observed over the model planning horizon. Under the scenarios with improved agricultural yields and increased charcoal prices and taxes, the clearing of available woodland was predicted at 98.3%. Biomass density was observed to decline by about 11.9% and 15.5% with the imposition of wood harvest and charcoal quotas. It was observed that none of the policy interventions in this study resulted in reduced degradation and deforestation, which posits a dilemma to the policy makers and implementers. However, we conclude that a well implemented system for taxes or quota restrictions would enhance sustainable resource use in the remaining woodland areas. These interventions are highly limited by implementation and enforcement problems that need to be properly addressed by policy makers and planners.

Kinabalu, Borneo. We investigated how soil N availability and ectomycorrhizal abundance related to the N-15 abundance of ecosystem components. delta N-15 values (N-15 abundance relative to N-14) increased consistently in the following order at each site: sun leaves, leaf litter, fine roots and from shallower organic to deeper mineral soil horizons. Enrichment (3-6 parts per thousand delta N-15) of N-15 occurred at the litter-topsoil interface at all sites, and the magnitude of the enrichment correlated negatively with N-15 depletion in the foliage, irrespective of ectomycorrhizal abundance. Foliar delta N-15 values significantly positively correlated with their N concentrations. Foliar (and litter and root) delta N-15 values correlated positively with NO3 availability, and negatively with NH4 availability. The two positive correlations of foliar delta N-15 with foliar N and NO3 availability were inconsistent with the assumption that stronger nitrification (hence a greater nitrate availability) produced a more N-15-depleted active inorganic N pool. The isotopic fractionation during the passage of N through ectomycorrhizas to plants might explain the positive correlation of foliar delta N-15 and N concentration; however, this mechanism could not fully explain the correlation in our case because strong foliar N-15 depletions occurred at the sites that lacked ectomycorrhizas. Alternatively, the positive correlation across sites reflected the tightness of N cycling. Strong nitrification and associated isotopic fractionation might have occurred at N-richer sites and the subsequent removal of NO3 from the system could decrease isotopically 'lighter' N at these sites.","Japanese Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kiso Expt Stn, Nagano 3970001, Japan",,"Kitayama, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",,,,,,,,33,41,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2001.0,229.0,2,,,,203,212,,10.1023/A:1004853915544,,,,,,,,WOS:000166868700006,

These sites are 1 to 3 km apart in the same wet evergreen forest. In the three study plots a total of 2150 stems (mean density 716 ha(-1)) covering 122 species in 89 genera and 41 families were enumerated. Species richness was greatest (85 species ha(-)1) in the undisturbed site UD, intermediate (83) in SF and lowest (80) in FD.

The forest stand was exceptionally voluminous in site UD (basal area 94.64 m(2) ha(-1)), intermediate (66.9 m(2)) in SF and least (61.7 m(2)) in FD, due to tree removal for fuel in the latter sites. Species composition and abundance patterns markedly varied between the three sites. In UD and SF, primary forest species (Cryptocarya bourdillonii , Cullenia exarillata Myristica dactyloides etc.) occurred in greater density.

However, another required step in understanding policy mixes is to understand how and why mixes evolve and change over time and to determine whether any changes are an improvement. In this paper, we analyse the development of a complex policy mix in the case of reclamation and remediation of the Alberta oil sands from an earlier 'simple goal, single instrument' policy regime to a more complex one. This case study reveals the presence of at least two dynamic processes at work in policy mix development, with significant implications for the nature of the changes that result from them.

The second `D' is poorly understood and accounted for a number of technical and policy reasons. Here we introduce a complete accounting method for estimating emission factors from selective timber harvesting, a substantial form of forest degradation in many tropical developing countries. The method accounts separately for emissions from the extracted log, from incidental damage to the surrounding forest, and from logging infrastructure, and emissions are expressed as units of carbon per cubic meter of timber extracted to allow for simple application to timber harvesting statistics. We applied the method in six tropical countries (Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Guyana, Indonesia, and Republic of Congo), resulting in total emission factors of 0.99-2.33 Mg C m(-3). In all cases, emissions were dominated by damage to surrounding vegetation and the infrastructure rather than the logs themselves, and total emissions represented about 3-15% of the biomass carbon stocks of the associated unlogged forests. We then combined the emission factors with country level logging statistics for nine key timber producing countries represented by our study areas to gain an understanding of the order of magnitude of emissions from degradation compared to those recently reported for deforestation in the same countries. For the nine countries included, emissions from logging were on average equivalent to about 12% of those from deforestation. For those nine countries with relatively low emissions from deforestation, emissions from logging were equivalent to half or more of those from deforestation, whereas for those countries with the highest emissions from deforestation, emissions from logging were equivalent to <10% of those from deforestation. Understanding how to account emissions and the magnitude of each emissions source resulting from tropical timber harvesting practices helps identify where there are opportunities to reduce emissions from the second `D' in REDD.","[Pearson, Timothy R.

Coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed images have wide swath and high temporal resolution. However, the mixed pixel problem lowers the mapping accuracy and hampers the application of these images. The development of remote sensing technology has enabled the storage of a great amount of medium spatial resolution images that recorded the historical conditions of the earth. The combination of timely updated coarse spatial resolution images and previous medium spatial resolution images is a promising technique for mapping forests in large areas with instant updating at low expense. Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a method for mapping land cover classes with a finer spatial resolution than the input coarse resolution image. This method can reduce the mixed pixel problem of coarse spatial resolution images to a certain extent. In this paper, a novel spatial-temporal SRM based on a Markov random field, called STMRF_SRM, is proposed using a current coarse spatial resolution Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer image and a previous medium spatial resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper image as input. The proposed model encourages the spatial smoothing of land cover classes for spatially neighboring subpixels and keeps temporal links between temporally neighboring subpixels in bitemporal images. Results show that the proposed STMRF_SRM model can generate forest maps with higher overall accuracy and kappa value.","[Li, Xiaodong; Du, Yun; Ling, Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, Key Lab Monitoring & Estimate Environm & Disaster, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China",,"Ling, F (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, Key Lab Monitoring & Estimate Environm & Disaster, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China.",lixiaodong@whigg.ac.cn; duyun@whigg.ac.cn; lingf@whigg.ac.cn,,,,,,,37,38,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2014.0,7.0,1,,,,29,39,,10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2264828,,,,,,,,WOS:000329059100003,

We make use of an input-output decomposition of a given specification described as a CNF formula, by alternatingly analyzing the separate input and output components. We exploit well-defined properties of these components to ultimately synthesize a solution for the entire specification. We first provide a theoretical result that, for input components with specific structures, synthesis for CNF formulas via this framework can be performed more efficiently than in the general case.

Re-examination of the type material of the recently established Nucellicolidae revealed several important observational errors in the original description, such as the oversight of the rootlet system in the adult female and misinterpretations of the tagmosis and antennulary segmentation in the late copepodid. Lamb et al.'s (1996) criteria used to justify the familial distinctiveness of the Nucellicolidae are all invalid. The family is relegated to a junior synonym of the Chitonophilidae on the basis of overwhelming support provided by copep did and adult morphology. The impact of heterochrony on the body plan of adults and developmental stages is discussed. Phylogenetic analysis supports a basal dichotomy dividing the Chitonophilidae into a mesoparasitic clade, utilizing exclusively polyplacophoran hosts, and a sisterclade grouping genera associated with chitons, prosobranch gastropods and cocculiniform limpets. The presence of maxillipeds and postmaxillipedal apodemes in the adult males of the latter clade is considered as apomorphic rather than plesiomorphic, being the result of incomplete moulting and correlated with the ventral position of the genital apertures. Nucellicola is identified as the sistergroup of the only other endoparasitic genus, Tesonesma, found in the body cavity of chitons. The inferred relationships indicate that host switching has occurred twice in the evolution of the Chitonophilidae. Examination of the antennulary segmentation and setation patterns of copepodids in Lepetellicola and Nucellicola unequivocally refutes both the current placement of the Chitonophilidae in the Poecilostomatoida and its alternative assignment to the Siphonostomatoida. Exclusion from the Poecilostomatoida is reinforced by the absence of a coxo-basis in the antenna. The family is placed with the cyclopoids, providing further evidence for the crown-group status of the Poecilostomatoida within the currently paraphyletic Cyclopoida. A critical review of the published reports of brooding in cocculiniform limpets demonstrated that there is, as yet, no tangible evidence for this phenomenon in either the Lepetelloidea or Cocculinoidea.

Such spatial analyses are important because regression models that exclude explicit specification of spatial effects, when they exist, can lead to inaccurate inferences about predictor variables. Using county-level data for 1990, we re-examine earlier published results [Friedman and Lichter (Popul Res Policy Rev 17:91-109, 1998)]. We find that formal tests for spatial autocorrelation among county child poverty rates confirm and quantify what is obvious from simple maps of such rates: the risk of a child living in poverty is not (spatially) a randomly distributed risk at the county level. Explicit acknowledgment of spatial effects in an explanatory regression model improves considerably the earlier published regression results, which did not take account of spatial autocorrelation. These improvements include: (1) the shifting of wrong sign parameters in the direction originally hypothesized by the authors, (2) a reduction of residual squared error, and (3) the elimination of any substantive residual spatial autocorrelation. While not without its own problems and some remaining ambiguities, this reanalysis is a convincing demonstration of the need for demographers and other social scientists to examine spatial autocorrelation in their data and to explicitly correct for spatial externalities, if indicated, when performing multiple regression analyses on variables that are spatially referenced. Substantively, the analysis improves the estimates of the joint effects of place-influences and family-influences on child poverty.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Rural Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Sociol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Northeastern Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Voss, PR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Rural Sociol, 340 Agr Hall,1450 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",voss@ssc.wisc.edu,,,,,,,104,105,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2006.0,25.0,4,,,,369,391,,10.1007/s11113-006-9007-4,,,,,,,,WOS:000242439400004,

Scaling coefficients were estimated to convert damage rate and logging intensity from one unit to another. Felled trees were smaller in the Neotropics (61 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) on average) than in Africa or Asia (92 cm dbh). A pantropical equation relating the proportion of trees damaged (alpha, no unit) to logging intensity (N-log, in ha(-1)) was fitted: alpha = 1 - (1 + 0.09135N(log))(-0.70461). A significant residual continent effect was found, with lower damage in the Neotropics than in Africa or Asia for the same level of logging intensity, in agreement with the size of felled trees. The damage rate varied with the size of damaged trees and divided equally between destroyed and injured trees, with injured trees experiencing a threefold mortality rate during 5-10 years. Taking account at least of the relationship between logging damage and logging intensity would improve the accuracy of forecasts in forest management.","[Picard, Nicolas; Gourlet-Fleury, Sylvie; Forni, Eric] CIRAD, B&SEF Unit, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",,"Picard, N (corresponding author), CIRAD, B&SEF Unit, Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",nicolas.picard@cirad.fr,,,,,,,29,29,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2012.0,42.0,3,,,,605,613,,10.1139/X2012-018,,,,,,,,WOS:000301042400016,

To address this, we develop the Deforestation Vulnerability Index (DVI) to identify spatial and temporal patterns of forest vulnerability from socio-economic processes. Composed of 13 socio-economic indicators, the DVI was applied to 24 LAC countries, and three provincial (sub-national) examples for the period 2000-2010. The DVI showed that vulnerability declined in more than 60% of countries, due to governance improvements and reductions in agricultural expansion. Provincial application of the index showed provinces to be more vulnerable than countries, due largely to higher economic dependence upon agriculture. Observed vulnerability reductions, whilst deforestation continues, may demonstrate a lag between socio-economic improvements and subsequent deforestation reductions, or the effects of omitted or unidentified vulnerability indicators.

Deforestation, which contributes a large proportion of total global emissions, must be avoided as an effective emissions-reduction tactic, and to alleviate biodiversity loss and poverty. However, incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) have had mixed and suboptimal success because of opportunity costs and administrative and technical issues, in particular, leakage, permanence, and additionality. We show that these latter concepts can be ambiguous, potentially contrived and in some cases, generate perverse outcomes. Encumbering avoided-deforestation projects with these administrative shackles risks massive increases in global deforestation and a concomitant loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services and emissions-reduction opportunities. We offer a solution built on a proven insurance-based hedging principle, a concept we call iREDD, that could indirectly address specific technical and administrative challenges, whether real or contrived. Project-specific iREDD insurance policies and premiums would be negotiated upfront using a simple assessment of risk based on governance quality, the integrity of management plans, liquidity, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and political acceptability. iREDD acts as both an incentive for prudent forest management given the seller's potential financial windfall if forests are diligently managed, and guarantees not to disenfranchise the buyer.","[Bradshaw, Corey J.

It was found that accessibility is a dominant element of transportation studies in rural sub-regions, if addressed by the concerned authorities or planning agencies; the deprived sub-regions can flourish and prosper with the passage of time.","[Talpur, Mir Aftab Hussain; Chandio, Imtiaz Ahmed; Shaikh, Fahad Ahmed] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept City & Reg Planning, Jamshoro, Pakistan; [Ali, Tauha Hussain] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Jamshoro, Pakistan",,"Talpur, MAH (corresponding author), Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept City & Reg Planning, Jamshoro, Pakistan.",aftab.talpur@faculty.muet.edu.pk; sacharvi2@gmail.com; imtiaz.chandio@faculty.muet.edu.pk; fahad.shaikh@faculty.muet.edu.pk,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2018.0,37.0,3,,,,603,614,,10.22581/muet1982.1803.14,,,,,,,,WOS:000436124700014,

The number of species present in a 26-year-old secondary forest attained 49% of the 72 species present in an old-growth forest. Total stem density decreased gradually from 172,500 ha(-1) in a 3-year-old forest to 24,600 ha(-1) in the 26-year-old stand, but stem density of larger trees (diameter at breast height (D) >= 5 cm) increased from 60 ha(-1) in a 7-year-old to 960 ha(-1) in the 26-year-old forests, which was similar to that of an old-growth forest. Annual biomass increment of the 26-year-old stand was 4.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). A saturation curve was fitted to biomass accumulation in secondary forests. After an estimated time of 60 years, a secondary forest can achieve 80% of the biomass of old-growth forests (240 Mg ha(-1)). Species diversity expressed by Shannon Index shows that it takes 60 years for a secondary forest in fallow to achieve a plant species diversity similar to that of old-growth forests.

In the Colorado River watershed in Madre de Dios, Peru, mining and deforestation have increased exponentially since the 1980s, resulting in major socioeconomic shifts in the region and two national state of emergency (2016 and 2019) in response to concerns for wide-scale mercury poisoning by these activities. This research employed a watershed-scale soil particle detachment model and environmental field sampling to estimate the role of land cover change and soil erosion on river transport of Hg in a heavily ASGM-impacted watershed. The model estimated that observed decreases in forest cover increased soil mobilization by a factor of two in the Colorado River watershed during the 18 year period and by 4-fold in the Puquiri subwatershed (the area of most concentrated ASGM activity) If deforestation continues to increase at its current exponential rate through 2030, the annual mobilization of soil and Hg may increase by an additional 20-25% relative to 2014 levels. While, the estimated total mass of Hg transported by rivers is substantially less than the estimated tons of Hg used with ASGM in Peru, this research shows that deforestation associated with ASGM is an additional mechanism for mobilizing naturally occurring and anthropogenic Hg from terrestrial landscapes to aquatic environments in the region, potentially leading to bioaccumulation in fish and exposure to communities downstream.","[Diringer, Sarah E.; Karatum, Osman; Hsu-Kim, Heileen] Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Berky, Axel J.; Marani, Marco; Ortiz, Ernesto J.; Pan, William K.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Berky, Axel J.; Pan, William K.] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Marani, Marco] Univ Padua, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Plata, Desiree L.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Karatum, Osman] Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA; [Diringer, Sarah E.] Pacific Inst, Oakland, CA 94612 USA",,"Hsu-Kim, H (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27710 USA.; Pan, WK (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27710 USA.; Pan, WK (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",william.pan@duke.edu; hsukim@duke.edu,,,,,,,14,14,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 7,2020.0,54.0,1,,,,286,296,,10.1021/acs.est.9b06620,,,,,,,,WOS:000506723200031,

An ASD field spectrometer (Analytical Spectral Device) was used to collect spectrum information of plant leaves from each species through 400 nm to 900 nm with 1 nm spectral resolution. Firstly, correlation between the physical/chemical characteristics of the leaves and the separability of each vegetation species was tested. Then, two feature selection methods, spectral angle and spectral distance, and the feature parameters extracted from spectral curves (FPESC) were used to build the feature space which would be the input space for the classifiers. At last, two linear classifiers, mahalanobis distance (MDC), and fisher linear discriminate analysis (FLDA), and a quadratic classifier, maximum likelihood (MLC), were used for vegetation species refine classification. The results showed that (1) there were no significant differences among 13 species on the leaf dry weight (physical parameter) and leaf chlorophyll content (chemical parameter); (2) FPESC of 13 species have distinctive differences and could be ideal features to discriminate these species; (3) The linear classifiers, MDC and FLDA, have better classification results in the experiments compared to the quadratic classifier MLC, where MDC has the highest classification accuracy which is above 96.2 %.","[Dian, Yuanyong; Xu, Yongrong; Yao, Chonghuai] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Fang, Shenghui; Le, Yuan] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",,"Dian, YY (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",dianyuanyong@126.com,,,,,,,8,9,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2014.0,42.0,1,,,,61,72,,10.1007/s12524-013-0309-9,,,,,,,,WOS:000333119900006,

We have previously shown that the backward SAR method considerably overestimates extinction rates due to a previously unrecognized sampling artifact. Jacob Bock Axelsen, Uri Roll, Lewi Stone, and Andrew Solow recently argued that the backward SAR method is correct and the method does not overestimate extinction rates. In this paper, we further elaborate and clarify our previous results. We show that the backward SAR method gives the correct extinction rate only under a strict complementary-area sampling design, which is not used in practice because it requires knowing which species are endemic to the area of destroyed habitat, or the number of species in the complementary area. Because of this problem, researchers substitute a power-law model for the SAR in the backward SAR equation. However, this substitution violates the backward SAR method's requirement for complementary sampling. With this model substitution, the backward SAR equation is no longer correct, except in the special case of randomly distributed species. For the complementary sampling or random distribution of species, the first individual of a species to be encountered and the last individual to be encountered to lose the species are exchangeable (or the same individual). But this is not the case for other sampling designs or if species are not randomly distributed and explains why the backward SAR method fails to correctly estimate extinction rates. Our proofs and results are general and explain the widely recognized overestimation of extinction by the backward SAR method. We suggest future directions for developing general theory for estimating species extinction from species-area relationships. Until then, however, the backward SAR method should not be used to estimate species extinction in practice.","[He, Fangliang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, SYSU Alberta Joint Lab Biodivers Conservat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Fangliang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Fangliang] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Hubbell, Stephen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hubbell, Stephen] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ctr Trop Forest Sci, Unit 0948, Apo Aa 340020948, Panama",,"He, FL (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, SYSU Alberta Joint Lab Biodivers Conservat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fhe@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,25,25,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2013.0,94.0,9,,,,1905,1912,,10.1890/12-1795.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000324532900003,

The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) established in 2008 an Environmental Quality Standard for biota (EQS(biota)) at 0.02 mu g.g(-1) fresh weight. This standard is not always adapted, such as in French Guiana subjected to high natural background Hg levels and intensive illegal gold mining. Therefore, this study focuses on how to apply the WFD for the definition of good chemical status (i.e., EQS(biota)) in a context of strong and generalized natural and anthropic Hg contamination. Based on Hg concentrations measured in 6208 fish over > 200 sites between 2004 and 2015, we first aimed at discriminating the natural or anthropogenic influences at each site. Then, as WFD recommends considering only high trophic level fish species as bioindicator species, we selected carnivorous/piscivorous fish species able to significantly accumulate Hg and discriminate reference sites from gold mining polluted sites. Total Hg concentrations measured in fish muscle were mostly above the EQS(biota) (100% for creeks and 84% for rivers), confirming the unsuitability of the direct application of this standard in French Guiana. Among the studied sites, few potential reference sites were identified: eight sites spread over six different watersheds for creeks, and only two areas (group of sites) both on the Oyapock watershed for rivers. Several relevant bioindicators fish species are proposed: ten species (over 35 species tested) belonging to seven genera on creeks (Moenkhausia oligolepis, Gymnotus carapo, Sternopygus macrurus, Jupiaba [abramoides + keithi], Pimelodella [cristata + geryi + macturki], Copella carsevennensis, Pyrrhulina filamentosa.), and four species (over 21 species tested) belonging to three genera on rivers (Acestrorhyncus [micropelis + falcatus], Hoplias aimara, Ageneiosus inermis). In order to facilitate field sampling, difficult in such remote hydrosystems, and to improve results interpretation, we tested the possibility to group some of these species. Our results indicate that only Jupiaba, Moenkhausia, Pimelodella and Pyrrhulina on creeks could be grouped; and the three bioindicators species proposed on rivers could be pooled. Finally, this work proposes in situ-based reference Hg concentrations for selected bioindicator fish species from French Guiana as an alternative to detect Hg-impacted sites and help the application of the WFD in tropical systems.","[Gentes, Sophie; Maury-Brachet, Regine] Univ Bordeaux, EPOC, UMR 5805, F-33120 Arcachon, France; [Coquery, Marina; Hanquiez, Vincent] Irstea, UR RiverLy, Ctr Lyon Villeurbanne, F-69625 Villeurbanne, France; [Vigouroux, Regis; Allard, Luc] HYDRECO, Kourou, Guyane, France",,"Gentes, S (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, EPOC, UMR 5805, F-33120 Arcachon, France.",so.gentes@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019.0,106.0,,,,,,,105468,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105468,,,,,,,,WOS:000490577900035,

However, objectives pursued in REDO projects may vary across policy makers. Within a theoretical framework, this paper explores the impacts of different policy objectives under two opportunity cost settings: asymmetric and full information. For a policy maker aiming to maximize net income from REDD, having full information may not increase the amount of forest conserved but could lead to a redistribution of rents away from agents. By contrast, for an environmental policy maker focused on maximizing the amount of forest conserved under REDO having full information increases the amount of forest conserved while reducing the rents received by agents. For a policy maker pursuing poverty alleviation objectives in REDD-affected communities, having full information makes no difference to overall welfare as rents remain with agents. The amount of deforestation avoided will at least be as high as under asymmetric information. These results are illustrated with data collected on opportunity costs in Amazonas State, Brazil.

Until now, scientists and policy makers tackling this issue had no geographically exhaustive information at the continental level about the spatial dynamics of this process. On the basis of a land use change-modeling framework we made a projection of potential land use changes for the year 2010. The chosen modeling framework incorporates a number of essential aspects of the complexity of land use change, such as the interrelation of spatial and temporal dynamics, land use history and scale dependence. The model was provided with up-to-date, continent wide, detailed information on present land use and its location factors, selected on the basis of literature. Model inputs were established in collaboration with experts from the region. Significant statistical relations were obtained that describe land use patterns in sub-regions, giving insights into the deforestation process and its location factors. Combined with decision rules and quantitative estimates of land use change, hot spots of forest to pasture and crop land conversion were projected. The results envisage a predominant replacement of forest by pasture. Substantially different trends among countries are predicted, both concerning the spatial patterns of deforestation and the substitution trends between land uses. The hot spot maps also show sensitive biological areas that may be at risk. The resulting continent wide map of projected change shall help to target policy attention and measures. It also provides a context to the numerous undergoing deforestation case studies.

Second, we adapt a land-use model to explain the trade-off between forest and agriculture during development. To take the link between both phenomena into account, we estimate a dynamic panel seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model along with a switching regression model, applied to a dataset of 57 developing countries observed over four time periods.

They also provide information about opportunities for improving natural resources management. Landscape indicators rely on data regarding land cover, land management and land functionality. Challenges in using landscape indicators to assess change and effects include (1) measures of land management and attributes that are reliable, robust and consistent for all areas on the Earth do not exist, and thus land cover is more frequently utilized; (2) multiple types of land cover and management are often found within a single landscape and are constantly changing, which complicates measurement and interpretation; and (3) while causal analysis is essential for understanding and interpreting changes in indicator values, the interactions among multiple causes and effects over time make accurate attribution among many drivers of change particularly difficult. Because of the complexity, sheer number of variables, and limitations of empirical data on land changes, models are often used to illustrate and estimate values for landscape indicators, and those models have several problems. Recommendations to improve our ability to assess the effects of changes in land management include refinement of questions to be more consistent with available information and the development of data sets based on systematic measurement over time of spatially explicit land qualities such as carbon and nutrient stocks, water and soil quality, net primary productivity, habitat and biodiversity. Well-defined and consistent land-classification systems that are capable of tracking changes in these and other qualities that matter to society need to be developed and deployed. Because landscapes are so dynamic, it is crucial to develop ways for the scientific community to work together to collect data and develop tools that will enable better analysis of causes and effects and to develop robust management recommendations that will increases land's capacity to meet societal needs in a changing world.

We thus suggest that policymakers seeking to protect the remaining forest should focus both incentives and enforcement of anti-deforestation laws in the larger properties where most of these forests are located.","[Richards, Peter D.] Brown Univ, Populat Studies & Training Ctr, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [VanWey, Leah] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Populat Studies & Training Ctr, Dept Sociol, Providence, RI 02912 USA",,"Richards, PD (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Populat Studies & Training Ctr, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",peter_richards@brown.edu,,,,,,,23,24,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2016.0,6.0,4,,,,418,+,,10.1038/NCLIMATE2854,,,,,,,,WOS:000373060000022,

Although the modern sector may be the source of dynamic growth through learning-by-doing and knowledge spillovers, patterns of labor, land and other natural resources use in the rural economy matter in the overall dynamics of structural change. The concentration of rural populations on marginal land is essentially a barometer of economy-wide development. As long as there is abundant marginal land for cultivation, they serve to absorb rural migrants, increased population, and displaced unskilled labor from elsewhere in the economy. Moreover, the economy is vulnerable to the Dutch disease effects of a booming primary products sector. As a consequence, productivity increases and expansion in the commercial primary production sector will cause manufacturing employment and output to contract, until complete specialization occurs. Avoiding such an outcome and combating the inherent dualism of the economy require both targeted polices for the modern sector and traditional agriculture on marginal land.","[Barbier, Edward B.; Bugas, John S.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",,"Barbier, EB (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",ebarbier@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,8,10,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 15,2014.0,23.0,1,,,,,,,10.1007/s40503-014-0003-5,,,,,,,,WOS:000332299300001,

The estimated mortality of 42 and 74% of stems >= 10 cm in once- and twice-burnt forest led to a substantial loss of fruiting tree basal area (29 and 62% were lost in once- and twice-burnt forest, respectively) and crown coverage of fruiting woody lianas (89 and 97% were lost in once- and twice-burnt forest, respectively). Some important tree families producing fleshy fruits were less abundant than expected in once- and twice-burnt forest, suggesting that tree mortality was non-random in terms of species composition. Asynchronous fruit production was affected, and burnt forest transects sustained a much lower fruiting basal area, and fewer fruiting species during the dry season period of fruit scarcity. The number of fruiting trees in once- and twice-burnt forest was higher than the number predicted from actual levels of tree mortality recorded in each fire disturbance treatment, suggesting some surviving trees which may have benefited from higher irradiance levels and lower competition for resources. Many large frugivores and other vertebrate species declined in response to single fires, and most primary forest specialists were extirpated from twice-burnt forest, which sustained a higher number of species associated with second growth and other disturbed habitats.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",,"Barlow, J (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",J.Barlow@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,61,65,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2006.0,15.0,3,,,,985,1012,,10.1007/s10531-004-3952-1,,,,,,,,WOS:000236356800012,

The results indicate a potential for developing a generic linear mixture model. However, the decision rules by which end-member fractions are classified into land cover classes are site-specific. Therefore a regional applicable and fully automated mapping approach is not realistic. This study concludes, however, that an approach which couples linear mixture modelling and decision tree classification is both accurate and robust for mapping tropical secondary forests across the region.","Univ Copenhagen, Inst Geog, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, Global Observ Ecosyst Serv, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Tottrup, C (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Inst Geog, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.",ct@geogr.ku.dk,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,,2007.0,28.0,6,,,,1263,1284,,10.1080/01431160600928575,,,,,,,,WOS:000245076800012,

However; there is strong evidence that permanent or semi-pennanent agriculture can itself create sustainably fertile soils known as 'Terra Preta' soils. These soils not only contain higher concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium, but also greater amounts of stable soil organic matter. Frequent findings of charcoal and highly aromatic humic substances suggest that residues of incomplete combustion of organic material (black carbon) are a key factor in the persistence of soil organic matter in these soils. Our investigations showed that 'Terra Preta' soils contained up to 70 times more black carbon than the surrounding soils. Due to its polycyclic aromatic structure, black carbon is chemically and microbially stable and persists in the environment over centuries. Oxidation during this time produces carboxylic groups on the edges of the aromatic backbone, which increases its nutrient-holding capacity. We conclude that black carbon can act as a significant carbon sink and is a key factor for sustainable acid fertile soils, especially in the humid tropics.","Univ Bayreuth, Inst Soil Sci & Soil Geog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",,"Glaser, B (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Inst Soil Sci & Soil Geog, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",,,,,,,,610,703,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2001.0,88.0,1,,,,37,41,,10.1007/s001140000193,,,,,,,,WOS:000167180800005,

The rate of deforestation is high in Mexico, as in other megadiverse countries, and protection of the country's biodiversity is a top priority. Quantification of changes in vegetation cover is essential for this purpose. Temporal information is required to enable classification of vegetation cover and change processes. In this study, the disturbances that occurred in the temperate forest of the SMO in the State of Durango (Mexico) during the period 1986-2012 were quantified using Landsat Time Series Stacks (LTSS) and the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) algorithm. The results obtained confirmed that land cover changes were detected with high overall accuracy (97.6%). In order to analyze the forest losses corresponding to the only official data available in Mexico, we retrieved land use and vegetation mapping (USV) data from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). The aridity index was established and fragmentation analysis was carried out in the study area, showing that forest pests and forest fires were the principal disturbance events in the SMO of Durango, and that the climate greatly influenced the occurrence of disturbances. The LTSS-VCT analysis revealed that for the period 1986-2012, about 34% of the temperate forest cover in the SMO in Durango was lost due to different types of disturbance, representing an annual rate of loss of forest cover of 1.3% and affecting 32,840 ha of land per year. The trend analysis of USV data showed very similar changes to those indicated by the LTSS-VCT analysis in terms of loss of temperate forest. However, differences were observed in regards to the absolute values of forest cover and vegetation loss, with analysis of the USV data indicating forest losses of 28% due to disturbances and an annual disturbance rate of 1%, affecting 49,940 ha of land per year.

Nevertheless, detailed ground-based quantifications of total carbon stocks in tropical montane forests are limited, despite their high value in science and ecosystem management (e.g. REDD+). The objective was to identify the role of these ecosystems as carbon stocks, to evaluate the contribution of the pools analyzed (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass and necromass), and to make contributions to the REDD+ approach from the project scale. For this study, we established 44 plots in a heterogeneous landscape composed by old-grown forests located in the Southern Colombian Andes. In each plot, all trees, palms and ferns with diameter (D) >= 15 cm were measured. In the case of palms, the height was measured for 40 % of the individuals, following the Colombia National Protocol to estimate biomass and carbon in natural forests. National allometric equations were used to estimate aboveground biomass, and a global equation proposed by IPCC was used for belowground biomass estimation; besides, palms' aboveground biomass was estimated using a local model. The necromass was estimated for dead standing trees and the gross debris. In the latter case, the length and diameters of the extremes in the pieces were measured. Samples for wood density estimations were collected in the field and analyzed in the laboratory. The mean total carbon stock was estimated as 545.9 +/- 84.1 Mg/ha (+/- S.E.). The aboveground biomass contributed with 72.5 %, the below ground biomass with 13.6 %, and the necromass with 13.9 %. The main conclusion is that montane tropical forests store a huge amount of carbon, similar to low land tropical forests. In addition, the study found that the inclusion of other pools could contribute with more than 20 % to total carbon storage, indicating that estimates that only include the aboveground biomass, largely underestimate carbon stocks in tropical forest ecosystems. These results support the importance of including other carbon pools in REDD+ initiatives' estimations.","[Yepes, Adriana; Sierra, Andres; Milena Nino, Luz; Lopez, Manuel] Direcc Bosques & Cambio Climat, Carrera 47A 91-91, Bogota, Colombia; [Garay, Cesar; Vargas, Diana] Corp Autonoma Reg Rio Grande Magdalena Cormagdale, Calle 93b 17-25 Oficina 504 Edificio Ctr Int Nego, Bogota, Colombia; [Cabrera, Edersson] Inst Hidrol Meteorol & Estudios Ambientales IDEAM, SMBYC, Subdirecc Ecosistemas & Informac Ambiental, Calle 25 96 B-70, Bogota, Colombia; [Barbosa, Adriana] Inst Hidrol Meteorol & Estudios Ambientales Colom, Subdirecc Ecosistemas & Informac Ambiental, Grp Bosques, Carrera 10 20-30, Bogota, Colombia",,"Yepes, A (corresponding author), Direcc Bosques & Cambio Climat, Carrera 47A 91-91, Bogota, Colombia.",ayepes@onfandina.com; asierra@onfandina.com; lmnino@onfandina.com; mlopez@onfandina.com; cesar.garay@cormagdalena.gov.co; diana.vargas@cormagdalena.gov.co; ecabreram@ideam.gov.co; abarbosa@ideam.gov.co,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2016.0,64.0,1,,,,399,412,,10.15517/rbt.v64i1.18221,,,,,,,,WOS:000381953400032,

There are numerous definitions for forest governance. The concept is commonly understood as a broad approach and assessment tools comprise dozens of indicators. However, there is no information about relations between single indicators, their individual importance and whether contextual factors modify their effects. This article aims to analyze if the hypothesized relation between governance leading to reduced tropical deforestation in general holds true, to identify the most decisive governance components and to explore if the wider socio-economic and political context influences potential governance effects. The structure - agency concept is used as theoretical basis to identify underlying mechanisms and as conceptual basis for discussing individual indicators. We employ a quantitative literature review based on scientific articles on governance and deforestation. From a total of 810 articles we select the most frequently cited publications related to the subject. From the resulting 198 papers only those are studied that contain empirical relations between governance and deforestation. The remaining 28 studies are analyzed by applying the governance indicators of the World Resource Institute as categories for content analysis. Likert scores are used to quantify governance effects as input for subsequent principal component analysis and multiple linear regressions. Results show that indeed high governance scores frequently relate to lower rates of deforestation and we thus recommend continued political support for the concept. But the reviewed studies mostly focus on a smaller number of classical governance indicators, which suggests that the governance concept might benefit from streamlining into a more targeted approach. In this respect, several indicators were related to underlying principal components reflecting the agency and structure concept. Even though we cannot claim a statistically significant stronger effect of one or the other component, single structural indicators were more strongly and more consistently linked to reduced deforestation in comparison to agency related indicators. The concept can thus be helpful to guide policy design and implementation.

How ants in each layer respond to environmental factors and to seasonality remains little studied. We hypothesized that ant species distribution varied spatially and seasonally among the three ground layers and that their distribution was distinctly affected by various abiotic and biotic factors. Ants were collected in an Ecuadorian premontane tropical forest and their distribution was analyzed spatio-temporally: vertically (between the ground surface, leaf-litter, and mineral soil, using pitfalls, Winkler, and soil cores), horizontally (every meter along a 100 m transect) and seasonally (between the dry and the rainy seasons). Four environmental parameters were measured every meter along the transect: canopy openness, slope, leaf-litter depth, and leaf-litter volume. Correlations between species distribution, richness, abundance, and environmental variables were calculated. Species richness was high, with 176 species collected along the transect. Our results show a clear vertical stratification, with distinct faunal composition in each layer and a strong seasonal effect. Stable distribution of several dominant species between seasons suggests a low nest relocation rate. During the dry season, higher ant richness and abundance were found in pitfall traps suggesting higher activity on the surface of the forest floor. Similarly, higher ant richness and abundance found in the soil during the dry season suggest the migration of drought-sensitive species downwards deeper into the soil. Species richness and dominant species distribution were related to distinct factors according to the layer considered; we found strong correlations between the quantity of leaf-litter and dominant ant species distribution and species richness in the leaf-litter layer, while no correlation was found with any factor in the soil layer. Our results show that ant faunal composition and the response of ants to environmental factors vary vertically at small spatial scale and seasonally, which emphasizes the importance of distinguishing layers in the ground matrix.","[Jacquemin, Justine; Leponce, Maurice] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Aquat & Terr Ecol ATECO, Rue Vautier 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Jacquemin, Justine; Roisin, Yves] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Evolutionary Biol & Ecol, Av FD Roosevelt 50,CP 160-12, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",,"Jacquemin, J (corresponding author), Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Aquat & Terr Ecol ATECO, Rue Vautier 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.; Jacquemin, J (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Evolutionary Biol & Ecol, Av FD Roosevelt 50,CP 160-12, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",jjacquemin@naturalsciences.be,,,,,,,13,14,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2016.0,22.0,,,,,129,139,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000371445200011,

Transmission cycles are maintained by haematophagous triatomine bug vectors that carry infective T. cruzi in their faeces. Most human infections are acquired by contamination of mucosal membranes with triatomine faeces after being bitten, however, T. cruzi can be transmitted by several other routes. Oral transmission is an increasingly important aspect of Chagas disease epidemiology, typically involving food or drink products contaminated with triatomines. This has recently caused numerous outbreaks and been linked to unusually severe acute infections. The long-term impact of oral transmission on infection dynamics and disease pathogenesis is unclear. We used highly sensitive bioluminescence imaging and quantitative histopathology to study orally transmitted T. cruzi infections in mice. Both metacyclic and bloodform trypomastigotes were infectious via the oral cavity, but only metacyclics led to established infections by intra-gastric gavage. Mice displayed only mild acute symptoms but later developed significantly increased myocardial collagen content (p = 0.017), indicative of fibrosis. Gastrointestinal tissues and skin were the principal chronic infection reservoirs. Chronic phase parasite load profiles, tissue distribution and myocardial fibrosis severity were comparable to needle-injected controls.

Conservation planning research has focused largely on where to prioritize protected areas to achieve the greatest representation of species at viable levels. Meanwhile research on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has focused largely on how to design payments to achieve the greatest additional reduction in greenhouse gases relative to baseline rates. This divergence of strategies and research agendas may be attributed to four factors: rare species are more heterogeneously distributed than carbon; species are more difficult to measure and monitor than carbon; species are more sensitive to ecological processes and human disturbance than carbon; and people's value for species diminishes beyond a threshold while their value for carbon storage does not. Conservation planning can achieve greater biodiversity benefits by adopting the concept of additionality from REDD+. REDD+ can achieve greater climate benefits by incorporating spatial prioritization from conservation planning. Climate and biodiversity benefits can best be jointly achieved from tropical forests by targeting the most additional actions to the most important places.

Achievements, deficits and potentials of continental to global scale land-use modeling",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,,,,Review,,,,,,,,"Land use plays a vital role in the earth system: it links human decision-making to the terrestrial environment and is both driver and target of global environmental changes. However, decisions about how much land to use where and for what purpose (and the related consequences) are still poorly understood. This deficit is in contrast to the fundamental need for global analysis of future land-use change to answer pressing questions concerning, e.g. future food security, biodiversity and climate mitigation and adaptation. In this review, we identify major achievements, deficits and potentials of existing continental to global scale land-use modeling approaches by contrasting current knowledge on land-use change processes and its implementation in models. To compare the 18 selected modeling approaches and their applications, we use the integration of geographic and economic modeling approaches as a guiding principle. Geographic models focus on the development of spatial patterns of land-use types by analyzing land suitability and spatial interaction. Beyond, they add information about fundamental constraints on the supply side. Economic models focus on drivers of land-use change on the demand side, starting out from certain preferences, motivations, market and population structures and aim to explain changes in land-intensive sectors. Integrated models seek to combine the strengths of both approaches in order to make up for their intrinsic deficits and to assess the feedbacks between terrestrial environment and the global economy. Important aspects in continental to global modeling of land use are being addressed by the reviewed models, but up to now for some of these issues no satisfying solutions have been found: this applies, e.g. to soil degradation, the availability of freshwater resources and the interactions between land scarcity and intensification of land use. For a new generation of large-scale land-use models, a transparent structure would be desirable which clearly employs the advantages of both geographic and economic modeling concepts within one consistent framework to include feedbacks and avoid redundancies.

Illegal private land deforestation threatens global biodiversity, even in areas with native habitat requirements stipulated by law. Compliance can be improved by allowing landholders to meet legal reserve requirements by buying and selling the rights to have deforested land through a Tradeable Development Rights system (TDR). While this policy mechanism may prevent native habitat area loss, the spatial pattern of reserved areas will shift, creating novel landscape patterns. The resulting altered fragmentation and connectivity of habitat will impact biodiversity. TDR may also allow landholders to earn rent on land they never intended on converting, resulting in additional deforestation elsewhere and net habitat loss. 2. We construct a simulation model to explore the potential implications for biodiversity when development rights can be traded, compared with the landscape resulting from enforced individual compliance with deforestation laws. 3. We find that where future deforestation is very likely, a TDR market can provide better outcomes for both biodiversity and agriculture, resulting in more connected habitat networks with larger fragments and fewer edge effects. However, the TDR market can be harmful if future deforestation is unlikely, or if one habitat type is tightly spatially correlated with high economic returns from agriculture. 4. Policy implications. Allowing landholders to buy and sell the rights to keep more cleared land than legally stipulated will result in transformed multiuse landscapes. Losses of native habitat in some areas will be offset in others. We conclude that trading forest development rights has the potential to improve habitat configurations, but that careful consideration should be given to current species distributions and likely future deforestation scenarios.","[Helmstedt, Kate J.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Potts, Matthew D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Helmstedt, KJ (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",kate.helmstedt@qut.edu.au,,,,,,,5,7,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2018.0,55.0,4,,,,1692,1700,,10.1111/1365-2664.13108,,,,,,,,WOS:000434970200013,

To overcome these limitations, we have used the Human Development approach to evaluate the management model of five electrification projects that use different technologies in Cajamarca (Peru). This approach enables a broader assessment of various key dimensions of development that should be considered in the management model.

Before biochar can be used on a large scale, especially in agricultural soils, its effects on the soil system need to be assessed. This is especially important in rice paddy soils that release large amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In this study, the effects of biochar on CH4 and CO2 emissions from paddy soil with and without rice straw added as an additional C source were investigated. The biochars tested were prepared from bamboo chips or rice straw which yielded bamboo char (BC) and straw char (SC), respectively. BC and SC were applied to paddy soil to achieve low, medium, and high rates, based on C contents of the biochars. The biochar-amended soils were incubated under waterlogged conditions in the laboratory. Adding rice straw significantly increased CH4 and CO2 emissions from the paddy soil. However, when soils were amended with biochar, CH4 emissions were reduced. CH4 emissions from the paddy soil amended with BC and SC at high rate were reduced by 51.1% and 91.2%, respectively, compared with those without biochar. Methanogenic activity in the paddy soil decreased with increasing rates of biochar, whereas no differences in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis patterns were observed. CO2 emission from the waterlogged paddy soil was also reduced in the biochar treatments. Our results showed that SC was more effective than BC in reducing CH4 and CO2 emissions from paddy soils. The reduction of CH4 emissions from paddy soil with biochar amendment may result from the inhibition of methanogenic activity or a stimulation of methylotrophic activity during the incubation period.","[Liu, Yuxue; Yang, Min; Chen, Yingxu; Wu, Weixiang] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yimin] Hangzhou 2 High Sch, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hailong] Scion, Rotorua 3046, New Zealand",,"Wu, WX (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",weixiang@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,205,269,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2011.0,11.0,6,,,,930,939,,10.1007/s11368-011-0376-x,,,,,,,,WOS:000294065600006,

While many studies of NTFP management have focused on the effects of harvesting on wild populations, the impacts of understory NTFP plantations, or enrichment plantings, on forest community composition and structure have not been investigated. We assessed the effects of understory plantations of the palm Chamaedorea hooperiana Hodel, on community composition and structure of an old growth tropical rain forest in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve in southeastern Mexico. A blocked design consisting of four C. hooperiana plantation sites each paired with an adjacent site of unmanaged forest was used to compare the plant species richness and diversity, stem density, basal area and size class structure in plantations versus unmanaged forest. In each site, 12 10 m diameter plots were established for a total of 96 plots (4 blocks x 2 sites x 12 plots). Although the stem density, diversity, richness and basal area of large overstory trees (> 20 cm dbh) were unaffected by the establishment and management of understory palm plantations, the stem density, species richness and basal area of woody species in smaller size classes (< 10 cm dbh) were significantly lower in plantation sites than in similar unmanaged forest sites. The density of naturally occurring, economically valuable pahn species was unaffected by the C. hooperiana plantations, indicating that these understory species are spared when plantations are established and maintained. However, plantation sites showed significant reductions in the density of the midstory palm Astrocaryum mexicanum, the most abundant plant in unmanaged forest sites. The removal of vegetation in NTFP plantations may result in the fragmentation and/or elimination of local populations of understory and midstory plant species. In addition, changes to the composition of advanced regeneration due to the removal of canopy tree seedlings and saplings may have implications for future patterns of forest regeneration and composition. Nonetheless, NTFP cultivation offers a promising alternative to more destructive forms of land uses in the tropics and warrants further attention as a forest management strategy.

CWD biomass and inputs are poorly documented in tropical rain forests (TRF), and the causes for their variation at landscape-scales in this biome have not been studied. We quantified standing and fallen CWD stocks and inputs in upland (non-swamp) old-growth TRF at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We used a network of 18 0.5 ha plots sited in three edaphic conditions to analyze soil nutrient effects on CWD stocks and inputs controlling for topography, and to examine topographic effects controlling for soil nutrients. The edaphic conditions were flat inceptisols. flat ultisols, and steep ultisols. Chemical analyses confirmed the existence of an almost three-fold gradient in total P and K in the upper I m of soil. We also annually censused all live woody stems greater than or equal to10 cm diameter above buttresses in each plot in September/October from 1997 to 2000 to obtain data on stand structure and dynamics. Fallen CWD stocks averaged 46.3 Mg ha(-1) (22.3 Mg C ha(-1)), while standing CWD averaged 6.5 Mg ha(-1) (3.1 Mg C ha(-1)). There were no significant differences in volume or mass of standing or fallen CWD among edaphic conditions. Annual inputs of CWD averaged 4.9 Mg ha(-1) (2.4 Mg C ha(-1)). Tumover time of fallen CWD was ca. 9 year. Neither stocks nor inputs were correlated with stand structure (number of trees per plot, plot basal area, or plot estimated above-ground biomass). Potential differences in CWD stocks and inputs among sites with different edaphic conditions may have been obscured by a 10-fold variation in tree mortality among plots and a two-fold variation in mean CWD input among years. Analysis of sample variance showed that stocks of CWD were adequately sampled with the 18 0.5 ha plot design. but that inputs were measured with low precision. At La Selva fallen and standing CWD stocks together equaled ca. 33% of estimated above-ground live woody biomass. Tropical rain forest CWD and its associated carbon are intermediate in pool size and turnover rate between fine litter and live trees. Our results show that scaling up TRF CWD estimates to larger spatial scales may be more constrained by the quality of data obtained over single landscapes than by variation due to zonal soil nutrient and topographic conditions. Both the magnitude and vagility of TRF CWD pools are likely to change with global climate change, but the overall direction of change is uncertain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We quantified ecosystem C stocks at the seaward, interior, and upland edges of mangroves in the Republic of Palau and Yap, Federated States of Micronesia. The relatively high aboveground biomass coupled with carbon-rich soils resulted in the presence of large ecosystem carbon stocks compared to other tropical forests. Ecosystem C storage at the Palau site ranged from 479 Mg/ha in the seaward zone to 1,068 Mg/ha in the landward zone; in the Yap site C storage ranged from 853 to 1,385 Mg/ha along this gradient.

Vegetation was classified in three broad classes: grasslands, secondary forests and primary forests which have been proved to enhance biomass estimates. MOD44 vegetation continuous fields (VCFs) was used as an explanatory variable for primary and secondary forests following an exponential relationship, while MOD13A1 enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used as explanatory variable for grasslands following a linear relationship; biomass for this vegetation class was estimated every 16 days given its large variation throughout the year. EVI-biomass relationships were established from 2001 to 2006. Vegetation maps were used to separate primary forests from secondary forest, since the latter has shown lower biomass levels. Confidence intervals of the exponential regression are larger as the biomass values increases, for this reason the uncertainty is quite high ranging from 3.7 to 25.2 millions of Mg with a mean of 16.2 million of Mg.

Based on land-use data, household surveys and social economic data in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, this study adopted the Binary Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) to analyze the driving factors of land-use spatio-temporal change in a large artificial forest area in the Ximeng County, Yunnan province, in Southwest China. Seventeen factors were used to reflect the socio-economic and natural environment conditions in the study area. The results show a land use pattern composed of forestland, dry cropland, and rubber plantation in Ximeng County. Over the past fifteen years, the area of artificial forests increased rapidly due to the Grain for Green policy, which has led to increases in rubber plantations, tea gardens, eucalyptus forests, etc. In contrast, the area of natural forest and dry cropland decreased due to reclamations for farming and constructions. The BLRM approach helped to identify the main driving factors of land-use spatio-temporal change, which includes land-use policies (protection of basic farmlands and natural reserves), topography (elevation and slope), accessibility (distance to the human settlements), and potential productivity (fertility and irrigation). The study revealed the relationship between land-use spatio-temporal change and its driving factors in mountainous Southwest China, providing a decision-making basis for rational land-use management and optimal allocation of land resources.","[Zhao, Xiaoqing; Pu, Junwei; Chen, Junxu] Yunnan Univ, Sch Resource Environm & Earth Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xingyou] Chongqing Architectural Design Inst, Chongqing 400000, Peoples R China; [Yang, Liang Emlyn] Univ Kiel, Grad Sch Human Dev Landscapes, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Gu, Zexian] Forestry Bur Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Lushui 673100, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, XQ; Chen, JX (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Resource Environm & Earth Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",xqzhao@ynu.edu.cn; pujunwei666@foxmail.com; wangxingyou1014@126.com; chenjunxu07@163.com; lyang@gshdl.uni-kiel.de; guzexian@sohu.com,,,,,,,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2018.0,10.0,11,,,,,,4066,10.3390/su10114066,,,,,,,,WOS:000451531700240,

Using panel data common to previous studies, we add the dimension of new political regimes, democratic and non-democratic, and investigate how the rate of agricultural land expansion in tropical countries depends on the nature and persistence of each regime. We find that both new autocratic and democratic regimes have accelerated the expansion of agricultural land, thus yielding support to some of the findings in the earlier literature. Interesting differences emerge between regions, with the impact being most pronounced in Latin America. We interpret these results mainly in the context of increasing tenure and ownership insecurity, which in turn is driven by the tendency of new regimes to implement land reforms as a form of social and economic policy or voter payback. The argument is developed more formally using a simple competitive land use model that incorporates political regime dependent confiscation risk and agricultural subsidy policy.","[Kuusela, Olli-Pekka] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Amacher, Gregory S.] Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",,"Kuusela, OP (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland.",olli-pekka.kuusela@luke.fi; gamacher@vt.edu,,,,,,,17,17,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2016.0,64.0,3,,,,445,463,,10.1007/s10640-015-9880-6,,,,,,,,WOS:000379185200005,

However, generalizations about the link between deforestation and specific variables or classes of variables are of questionable validity. Another approach, one that is receiving growing attention, seeks instead to identify particular contexts or situations, as created by an array of interacting factors, which encourage forms of land use or other economic activity that can generate deforestation pressure. Such an approach was used in this study to explore recent trends and dynamics in the Peten region of northern Guatemala. The research found a number of regional and national scale factors that in combination have led to a process of de-agrarianization and dispossession among smallholders, while large scale, commercial activities in agriculture, ranching and plantation forestry increasingly dominate. Rapid land concentration, in conjunction with limited employment generation through emergent activities, is intensifying pressure on remaining areas of forest. A focus on two distinct areas within Peten reveals how broader-scale trends and features can have differing outcomes at the local level, with contrasting socioeconomic and environmental effects. Finally, the paper explores the implications of recent dynamics in Peten for both policy and theory in relation to deforestation, agrarian change, and regional development. Key factors and questions are highlighted that should be considered when exploring influences on regional socioeconomic and environmental conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

New roads have also been shown to cause deforestation, suggesting development-environment tradeoffs for the locations where studies have focused to date. Yet in other settings, multiple mechanisms could support a different road-forest relationship, at least partially alleviating this tradeoff. New roads could promote reforestation by: (1) raising the relative productivity of labor in non-agricultural sectors, thereby reducing agricultural activity; (2) facilitating price convergence across regional forest-product markets, raising profits from forest management or plantations: and/or (3) encouraging substitution from locally collected fuelwood to other energy sources. India's Rural Roads Program offers an opportunity to explore these hypotheses in a large country with little previous investigation of the road-forest relationship. Program rules prioritized construction by village population ranges, which differentiated construction timing across villages. I exploit this with a generalized difference-in-differences estimation strategy, having combined satellite, survey and census data to create a village-level, countrywide panel for 2000-2014. Road impacts are found to have considerable variation across economic settings within India: frontier-like settings saw reductions in tree cover due to new roads, while less isolated settings with greater existing agricultural development saw increases in tree cover. These results inform the spatial targeting of roads for environmentally-sensitive development, while broadening the set of mechanisms used to explain forest transitions (the reversal of forest cover loss).

This study therefore evaluated the benefits of integrating the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) L-band HH and HV polarisation response from the woody components of vegetation with Landsat-derived foliage projective cover (FPC). Focus was on 12 regional ecosystems (REs) distributed across the Brigalow Belt Bioregion (BRB) of Queensland, Australia, where different stages of growth dominated by brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) were widespread. From remnant areas of brigalow-dominated forests mapped previously for each RE by the Queensland Herbarium through field visits and interpretations of aerial imagery, frequency distributions of all three channels were extracted and compared to those of image segments generated using FPC and PALSAR data. For woody vegetation (with an FPC threshold of >= 9%) outside of the remnant areas, mature (non-remnant) forests were associated with segments where the HH and HV backscatter thresholds were within one standard deviation of the mean extracted for remnant forest. Early-stage regrowth was differentiated using an L-band HH threshold of < - 14 dB, common for all REs because of similarities in structure at this stage. The early-stage included forests regrowing over several decades and often occurred in areas recovering from recent clearing events. Objects falling between the early and mature stages were considered to be intermediate regrowth and/or degraded forest. All areas with an FPC <9% were mapped as non-forest. Within the BRB, the Queensland Herbarium established that forests with brigalow as a dominant or subdominant component originally occupied over 73 million ha but were reduced to 586,364 ha by 2009, with 460,499 ha (78.5%) having brigalow as the dominant component Using the Landsat FPC and ALOS PALSAR data, an additional 722,686 ha of brigalow-dominated regrowth forest were identified giving a total forested area (brigalow-dominated remnant and secondary forest) of 1,183,185 ha or 17.2% of the area of the 12 REs. Within this area, the greater proportion of regrowth (368,473 ha or 31.1%) was mapped as early stage primarily because of recovery following recent clearance events. 230,551 (19.5%) ha and 123,662 ha (10.5%) were mapped as intermediate and mature (non-remnant) stages respectively and the remainder (38.9%) was remnant forest. Users' and producers' accuracies were, respectively, 81% and 69% for early regrowth and 71% and 89% for mature and intermediate stage forests combined. The mapping, which used Queensland Herbarium's RE data to delineate brigalow extent, provided a structural, rather than age-based classification of growth stage, as is typically retrieved using time-series comparison of optical imagery. The regional estimates of growth/degradation stage generated for the BRB provide a basis for optimising the use and recovery of these threatened brigalow ecosystems with benefits for biodiversity and carbon sequestration.

Ammonium nitrogen (NH4 (+)-N) concentrations in the leachate of the soil columns showed significant differences at different depths after ammonium chloride application to the columns depending on whether BC had been added.

In addition, application of BC reduced overall cumulative losses of NH4 (+)-N via leaching at 20 cm by 15.2%.

Stronger land property rights could possibly enable farmers to increase input intensity and productivity on the already cultivated land, thus reducing incentives to expand their farms by deforesting additional land. This hypothesis is tested with data from a panel survey of farm households in Sumatra. The survey data are combined with satellite imageries to account for spatial patterns, such as historical forest locations. Results show that plots for which farmers hold formal land titles are cultivated more intensively and are more productive than untitled plots. However, due to land policy restrictions, farmers located at the historic forest margins often do not hold formal titles. Without land titles, these farmers are less able to intensify and more likely to expand into the surrounding forest land to increase agricultural output.

It is believed to be over 2000 years old. Today, AGM has escalated in a new dimension consuming about half of the country where gold lode deposits exist along riverbanks or rivers are alluvial-gold rich. The Pra River in southwestern Ghana is a site of on going application of metallic mercury in prospecting gold, and this paper examines mercury (Hg) contamination in the different environmental compartments in its watershed. Samples of water, sediment, soil and biota (i.e., human hair and fish) were collected from locations along the course of the river during the rainy and dry seasons of 2002 and 2003, respectively. Besides the obvious Hg point sources along the Pra and its tributaries, the obtained results show that Hg levels and speciation in the studied aquatic system are controlled by precipitation, which drives the hydrology and differences in flow regimes versus seasons. The seasonal difference in Hg speciation suggests that methyl mercury (MeHg) found in the aqueous phase and riverine sediments is likely of terrestrial origin where its production is favored during the rainy season by high soil water and organic matter content. The use of the enrichment factor (EF) for the assessment of sediment quality indicated moderate to severe contamination of surface sediments in the rainy season, while in the dry season, the EF index indicates nearly no pollution of surface sediments. Accordingly, most of the Hg introduced into this river system is likely transported to depositional downstream terminal basins (e.g. the river delta and the Gulf of Guinea). With regard to biota, Hg measured in hair in the dry period was higher than data obtained on samples collected during the wet period. This could be explained at least in part by the shift in diet as a result of abundance of fish in the local markets and the concurrent increase and more active fishing during the dry season. Mercury data obtained on a very limited number of fish samples collected during the dry period only are also presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The research area in the Southern Ecuadorian Andes included forest, annual (0-5 years old) and different aged perennial (0-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-30) and pasture (0-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-30, >30) sites. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total and plant available soil nutrient stocks and nutrient balances were investigated to assess temporal soil nutrient dynamics in relation to management activities. Forest conversion by slash-and-burn caused a decrease in SOC stocks in all three land-uses amounting between 14% and 19%. This was mainly due to the absence of an organic layer and losses in the upper five cm of the mineral soil. Stocks of exchangeable bases and pH values increased in annuals which however, had the most negative nutrient balance of all land-uses amounting to -128, -25 and -226 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for N, P and K, respectively. The abandonment of annual sites after five years was linked to a shortage of available N and P due to low-external-input management which caused SOC stock decreases. Major soil nutrient changes in perennials and pastures did not occur directly but 6-20 years after forest conversion with increases in stocks for total N, P, S and exchangeable bases above forest level. SOC stocks of medium aged perennials and pastures increased above forest level in the mineral soil. Easily available inorganic N and P stocks remained low throughout the chronosequence in perennials and pastures, indicating a quick uptake by plant roots and microorganisms. Compared to medium aged sites, oldest perennials and pastures showed a strong decrease in SOC (-28% and -16%) and soil nutrient stocks. Stocks for total N, P, S and exchangeable bases were up to 50% below those of medium aged sites in oldest perennials and pastures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We here assess the usefulness of multispectral canopy reflectance (Landsat) relative to climate data in modelling understory plant species distributions in tropical rainforests. We used a large dataset of quantitative fern and lycophyte species inventories across lowland Amazonia as the basis for species distribution modelling (SDM). As predictors, we used CHELSA climatic variables and canopy reflectance values from a recent basin-wide composite of Landsat TM/ETM+ images both separately and in combination. We also investigated how species accumulate over sites when environmental distances were expressed in terms of climatic or surface reflectance variables. When species accumulation curves were constructed such that differences in Landsat reflectance among the selected plots were maximised, species accumulated faster than when climatic differences were maximised or plots were selected in a random order. Sixty-nine species were sufficiently frequent for species distribution modelling. For most of them, adequate SDMs were obtained whether the models were based on CHELSA data only, Landsat data only or both combined. Model performance was not influenced by species' prevalence or abundance. Adding Landsat-based environmental data layers overall improved the discriminatory capacity of SDMs compared to climate-only models, especially for soil specialist species. Our results show that canopy surface reflectance obtained by multispectral sensors can provide studies of tropical ecology, as exemplified by SDMs, much higher thematic (taxonomic) detail than is generally assumed. Furthermore, multispectral datasets complement the traditionally used climatic layers in analyses requiring information on environmental site conditions. We demonstrate the utility of freely available, global remote sensing data for biogeographical studies that can aid conservation planning and biodiversity management.","[Van Doninck, Jasper; Jones, Mirkka M.; Zuquim, Gabriela; Ruokolainen, Kalle; Moulatlet, Gabriel M.; Siren, Anders; Cardenas, Glenda; Lehtonen, Samuli; Tuomisto, Hanna] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland; [Van Doninck, Jasper] Univ Turku, Dept Geog & Geol, Turku, Finland; [Jones, Mirkka M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Appl Phys, Aalto, Finland; [Moulatlet, Gabriel M.] Univ Reg Amazon Ikiam, Tena, Napo, Ecuador; [Lehtonen, Samuli] Univ Turku, Biodivers Unit, Turku, Finland",,"Tuomisto, H (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland.",hanna.tuomisto@utu.fi,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2020.0,43.0,1,,,,128,137,,10.1111/ecog.04729,,OCT 2019,,,,,,WOS:000491568900001,

To investigate P. vivax antimalarial susceptibility in Cambodia, 76 fresh P. vivax isolates collected from Oddar Meanchey (northern Cambodia) in 2013-2015 were assessed for ex vivo drug susceptibility using the microscopy-based schizont maturation test (SMT) and a Plasmodium pan-species lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) ELISA. P. vivax multidrug resistance gene 1 (pvmdr1) mutations, and copy number were analysed in a subset of isolates. Results: Ex vivo testing was interpretable in 80% of isolates using the pLDH-ELISA, but only 25% with the SMT. Plasmodium vivax drug susceptibility by pLDH-ELISA was directly compared with 58 P. falciparum isolates collected from the same locations in 2013-4, tested by histidine-rich protein-2 ELISA. Median pLDH-ELISA IC50 of P. vivax isolates was significantly lower for dihydroartemisinin (3.4 vs 6.3 nM), artesunate (3.2 vs 5.7 nM), and chloroquine (22.1 vs 103.8 nM) than P. falciparum but higher for mefloquine (92 vs 66 nM). There were not significant differences for lumefantrine or doxycycline. Both P. vivax and P. falciparum had comparable median piperaquine IC50 (106.5 vs 123.8 nM), but some P. falciparum isolates were able to grow in much higher concentrations above the normal standard range used, attaining up to 100-fold greater IC(50)s than P. vivax. A high percentage of P. vivax isolates had pvmdr1 Y976F (78%) and F1076L (83%) mutations but none had pvmdr1 amplification. Conclusion: The findings of high P. vivax IC50 to mefloquine and piperaquine, but not chloroquine, suggest significant drug pressure from drugs used to treat multidrug resistant P. falciparum in Cambodia. Plasmodium vivax isolates are frequently exposed to mefloquine and piperaquine due to mixed infections and the long elimination half-life of these drugs. Difficulty distinguishing infection due to relapsing hypnozoites versus blood-stage recrudescence complicates clinical detection of P. vivax resistance, while well-validated molecular markers of chloroquine resistance remain elusive. The pLDH assay may be a useful adjunctive tool for monitoring for emerging drug resistance, though more thorough validation is needed. Given high grade clinical chloroquine resistance observed recently in neighbouring countries, low chloroquine IC50 values seen here should not be interpreted as susceptibility in the absence of clinical data. Incorporating pLDH monitoring with therapeutic efficacy studies for individuals with P. vivax will help to further validate this field-expedient method.","[Chaorattanakawee, Suwanna; Lon, Chanthap; Chann, Soklyda; Sundrakes, Siratchana; Thamnurak, Chatchadaporn; Chattrakarn, Sorayut; Praditpol, Chantida; Yingyuen, Kritsanai; Wojnarski, Mariusz; Spring, Michele D.; Walsh, Douglas S.; Lanteri, Charlotte A.; Saunders, David L.] Armed Forces Res Inst Med Sci, Dept Immunol & Med, Bangkok, Thailand; [Chaorattanakawee, Suwanna] Mahidol Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Parasitol & Entomol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Thay, Kheang Heng; Kong, Nareth; You, Yom; Huy, Rekol] Natl Ctr Parasitol Entomol & Malaria Control, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Patel, Jaymin C.; Lin, Jessica; Juliano, Jonathan J.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Saunders, David L.] US Army Med Mat Dev Act, Frederick, MD USA",,"Chaorattanakawee, S (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Parasitol & Entomol, Bangkok, Thailand.",suwann67@yahoo.com,,,,,,,16,16,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 30,2017.0,16.0,,,,,,,392,10.1186/s12936-017-2034-2,,,,,,,,WOS:000412212500001,

The impact of physical damage in seedling mortality was evaluated in forest fragments and continuous forests in central Amazonia using artificial seedlings. A total of 11 reserves distributed among three sires were studied: three 1-ha, three 10-ha, two 100-ha, and three continuous forest reserves. In each reserve, ten transects each comprised of ten artificial seedlings were monitored for one year at four-week intervals. Survival curves were compared using failure time analysis, and the effect of reserve size on artificial seedling mortality after one year was analyzed with a categorical model. In the analysis of survival curves, artificial seedling survival was significantly greater in the continuous forest than in the 10-ha reserve at one site only, a result that may have occurred by chance. After one year, artificial seedlings suffered similar mortality due to litterfall among the reserves sampled. Physical damage by litterfall varied from 28 to 35 percent annually in the 1- and 10-ha forest fragments compared to 20 to 24 percent in the continuous forest. Mortality of artificial seedlings in the continuous forest was similar to other tropical sites in which the same method has been used, and may indicate that litterfall plays an important rule in seedling morality in the terra firme tropical forests of central Amazonia.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Scariot, A (corresponding author), EMBRAPA, CENARGEN, CP 02372, BR-70770900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",,,,,,,,66,86,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2000.0,32.0,4,,,,662,669,,10.1646/0006-3606(2000)032[0662:SMBLIA]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,WOS:000166540200009,

The most widely-used method to convert woody debris volume to carbon is by first multiplying field-measured volume with wood density to obtain necromass, and then assuming that a fixed proportion (often 50%) of the necromass is carbon. However, this crucial assumption is rarely tested directly, especially in the tropics. The aim of this study is to verify the field carbon concentration values of living trees and woody debris in two distinct tropical forests in Taiwan. Wood from living trees and woody debris across five decay classes was sampled to measure density and carbon concentrations. We found that both wood density and carbon concentration (carbon mass/total mass) declined significantly with the decay class of the wood. Mean ( SE) carbon concentration values for living trees were 44.6 +/- 0.1%, while for decay classes one to five they were respectively 41.1 +/- 1.4%, 41.4 +/- 1.0%, 37.7 +/- 1.3%, 30.5 +/- 2.0%, and 19.6 +/- 2.2%. Total necromass carbon stock was low, only 3.33 +/- 0.55 Mg C ha(-1) in the windward forest (Lanjenchi) and 4.65 +/- 1.63 Mg C ha(-1) in the lowland forest (Nanjenshan). Applying the conventional 50% necromass carbon fraction value would cause a substantial overestimate of the carbon stocks in woody debris of between 17% and 36%, or about 1 Mg of carbon per hectare. The decline in carbon concentration and the increase of variances in the heavily decayed class suggest that in high-diversity tropical forests there are diverse decomposition trajectories and that assuming a fixed carbon fraction across woody pieces is not justified. Our work reveals the need to consider site-specific and decay class-specific carbon concentrations in order to accurately estimate carbon stocks and fluxes in forest ecosystems. If the marked decline in carbon content with necromass decay is typical of tropical forests, the dead wood carbon pool in the biome needs revision and is likely to be overestimated.

These conflicts require judicial decisions by law courts at various hierarchical levels. However, few studies examine the regular pattern of relevant judicial decisions to improve the resolution of conflicts related to LAR in China. The current study aims to identify the regular pattern of jurisdiction in the field of LAR in Zhejiang Province by examining 901 administrative litigation cases. Docking and blocking net, through which determines whether a judge supports plaintiffs in a nomological basis, is used to investigate these cases. Statistical analysis of jurisdictions, defendants, and causes of action was conducted in the study. Results indicate that jurisdictions, executive positioning of respondents, and causes of lawsuits are key issues that affect the judgment of the docking blocking net. Results reveal that the temporal-hierarchical level of jurisdiction is negatively correlated with the plaintiffs' winning rate. The docking and blocking mechanism system of high-level courts within a jurisdiction likely provides adverse referees to plaintiffs. The executive positioning of respondents also affects judicial results. The plaintiffs' winning rate deviates depending on the causes of lawsuits. Plaintiffs and defendants use the three factors to further their own interests as much as possible through affecting the final judicial decisions of the docking blocking net. This study seeks to improve the legitimacy of executive action, thereby reducing the judicial costs of executive acts. The study contributes to the prevention of existing administrative and judicial conflicts of LAR by clarifying the weak points of administrative departments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimates are presented based on a 1:2 million scale soil and terrain (SOTER) database for Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda (hereafter referred to as Central Africa). Each SOTER map unit consists of up to six soil components, characterized by a representative soil profile extracted from survey data. Gaps in the measured soil analytical data were filled using consistent, taxonomy-based pedotransfer procedures. Natural variation in individual soil components was simulated to put bounds on regional-scale carbon stocks rather than a single figure. The 95% confidence interval for the median stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) to 1 m is 19.3 to 19.6 Pg C: this corresponds with some 11% of African and about 1% of worldwide SOC stocks to that depth. The area-weighted SOC content is largest in the cool, humid mountains (22.1-22.7 kg C m(-2)) in part due to the presence of soils formed on volcanic parent materials, and smallest for the warm savannah region (7.6-7.7 kg C m(-2)). Local differences in SOC content are related to type and texture of parent material, soil drainage conditions, and land use/vegetation. Less than 1% of the region consists of soil units that contain secondary carbonates (-0.19 Pg C), accounting for -0.8% of the total carbon stock to 2 m in the soils of Central Africa. About 45% of the SOC stock to 2 m is held in the upper 30 cm; much of this would be released to the atmosphere as CO2 upon forest clearance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Post-harvest basal area growth generally increased with harvest intensity, and total basal areas for trees greater than or equal to5 cm DBH were, at the time of our study, 60% (in the clear-cut) to about 80% of those in the control plots. Biomass harvests stimulated recruitment and growth of residual trees, particularly in the smaller diameter classes, but had little effect on species richness for small trees, seedlings, vine, herbs, and grasses.

This zone has better conditions to support rainfed agricultural production, wood energy supply and fodder for livestock but it also experiences the highest rate of deforestation in the country. This study analyses the drivers of deforestation in Ziro province of Southern Burkina Faso. For data collection and analysis, the area of forest cleared annually was used as the dependent variable, whereas household characteristics and local institutions (tenure and property rights) were considered independent variables. Data were collected through focus group discussions (FGD), participant observation, interviews with key informants and from 200 farm households. Tobit regression results reveal that land tenure insecurity and low agricultural production expressed in the sizes (areas) and ages of farms led to increased deforestation. In addition, the significance of tenure insecurity as a driver of deforestation indicated that migrants contributed more to deforestation than the indigenous groups. Greater rights and improved legal status might reduce the rights to limited use granted to migrants. Furthermore, supports from government to increase local community's capacity to monitor protected forests are likely to reduce field expansion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental plots located at the Nippon Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) received cattle compost at different rates for 12 years; a forest soil at this site was sampled for comparison. Swine compost application led to a considerable change in the delta(15)N distribution pattern in the soil profile, with the highest delta(15)N values recorded in the top 20 cut layers of the COMPOST plot, decreasing in the sequence of CONTROL greater than or equal to RANF > SRNF, mainly due to the relatively high delta(15)N value of swine compost and its subsequent decomposition. In contrast, SRNF application resulted in the lowest delta(15)N values in soil, indicating the presence of negligible nitrogen losses relative to input and low nitrogen cycling rates. Values of delta(15)N increased with compost application rates at NARI. In the leachate collected at 1-m depth, the delta(15)N values decreased in the sequence of COMPOST > RANF CONTROL > SRNF. The delta(13)C values in soil peaked in the 40-60 cm layers for all the fertilizers. The delta(13)C value was lowest in forest soil due to the presence of plant residues in soil organic matter.

Its parameterization in atmospheric chemistry models represents a significant source of uncertainty for the global tropospheric ozone budget and might account for the mismatch with observations. The model used in this study, the Modular Earth Submodel System version 2 (MESSy2) linked to the fifth-generation European Centre Hamburg general circulation model (ECHAM5) as an atmospheric circulation model (EMAC), is no exception. Like many global models, EMAC employs a resistance in series scheme with the major surface deposition via plant stomata which is hardly sensitive to meteorology, depending only on solar radiation. Unlike many global models, however, EMAC uses a simplified high resistance for nonstomatal deposition which makes this pathway negligible in the model. However, several studies have shown this process to be comparable in magnitude to the stomatal uptake, especially during the night over moist surfaces. Hence, we present here a revised dry deposition in EMAC including meteorological adjustment factors for stomatal closure and an explicit cuticular pathway. These modifications for the three stomatal stress functions have been included in the newly developed MESSy VERTEX submodel, i.e. a process model describing the vertical exchange in the atmospheric boundary layer, which will be evaluated for the first time here. The scheme is limited by a small number of different surface types and generalized parameters. The MESSy submodel describing the dry deposition of trace gases and aerosols (DDEP) has been revised accordingly. The comparison of the simulation results with measurement data at four sites shows that the new scheme enables a more realistic representation of dry deposition. However, the representation is strongly limited by the local meteorology. In total, the changes increase the dry deposition velocity of ozone up to a factor of 2 globally, whereby the highest impact arises from the inclusion of cuticular uptake, especially over moist surfaces. This corresponds to a 6 % increase of global annual dry deposition loss of ozone resulting globally in a slight decrease of ground-level ozone but a regional decrease of up to 25 %. The change of ozone dry deposition is also reasoned by the altered loss of ozone precursors. Thus, the revision of the process parameterization as documented here has, among others, the potential to significantly reduce the overestimation of tropospheric ozone in global models.","[Emmerichs, Tamara; Kerkweg, Astrid; Taraborrelli, Domenico] Forschungszentrum Julich, Troposphere, Inst Energy & Climate Res 8, Julich, Germany; [Ouwersloot, Huug] Max Planck Inst Chem, Mainz, Germany; [Fares, Silvano] CNR, Inst Bioecon, Rome, Italy; [Mammarella, Ivan] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, Helsinki, Finland",,"Taraborrelli, D (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Troposphere, Inst Energy & Climate Res 8, Julich, Germany.",d.taraborrelli@fz-juelich.de,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 26,2021.0,14.0,1,,,,495,519,,10.5194/gmd-14-495-2021,,,,,,,,WOS:000613895800001,

This study also adopts spatial techniques to allow for neighborhood effects from land-use activities in neighboring areas. Key findings include the following: higher land suitability hinders the process of agricultural land abandonment; road density prohibits agricultural land conversion to natural land; the implementation of conservation sites protects land in its natural status; and land-use activities have strong neighborhood effects on nearby regions. Incorporating spatial interactions can generate less biased empirical results and provide more accurate policy recommendations. In addition, an investigation of bi-directional land-use transitions helps to better understand the associated gains and losses between agriculture and natural land and offers further insights into the effectiveness of preservation programs that aim to protect wild space and maintain ecological balance.

Landscapes in the Yucatan Peninsula are composed of a mosaic of old growth subtropical forest, secondary vegetation, grasslands, and agricultural land that represent a well-documented example of anthropogenic intervention, much of which involves the use of fire. This research characterizes land use systems and land cover changes in the Yucatan during the 2000-2010 time period. We used an active fire remotely sensed data time series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in combination with forest loss, and anthrome map sources to (1) establish the association between fire and land use change in the region; and (2) explore links between the spatial and temporal patterns of fire and specific types of land use practices, including within- and between-anthromes variability. A spatial multinomial logit model was constructed using fire, landscape configuration, and a set of commonly used control variables to estimate forest persistence, non-forest persistence, and change. Cross-tabulations and descriptive statistics were used to explore the relationships between fire occurrence, location, and timing with respect to the geography of land use. We also compared fire frequencies within and between anthrome groups using a negative binomial model and Tukey pairwise comparisons. Results show that fire data broadly reproduce the geography and timing of anthropogenic land change. Findings indicate that fire and landscape configuration is useful in explaining forest change and non-forest persistence, especially in fragmented (mosaicked) landscapes. Absence of fire occurrence is related usefully to the persistence of spatially continuous core areas of older growth forest. Fire has a positive relationship with forest to non-forest change and a negative relationship with forest persistence. Fire is also a good indicator to distinguish between anthrome groups (e.g., croplands and villages). Our study suggests that active fire data series are a reasonable proxy for anthropogenic land persistence/change in the context of the Yucatan and are useful to differentiate quantitatively and qualitatively between and within anthromes.","[Millones, Marco] Univ Mary Washington, Dept Geog, 1301 Coll Ave, Fredericksburg, VA 23219 USA; [Rogan, John] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Turner, B.

Timely and spatially referenced information on the extent of galamsey is needed to understand and limit the negative impacts of Mining. To address this, we use multi-date UK-DMC2 satellite images to map the extent and expansion of galamsey from 2011 to 2015. We map the total area of galamsey in 2013 over the cocoa growing area, Using k-means clustering on a cloud-free 2013 image with strong spectral contrast between galamsey and the surrounding vegetation. We also process a pair of hazy images from 2011 and 2015 with Multivariate Alteration Detection to map the 2011-2015 galamsey expansion in a subset, labelled the change area. We use a set of visually interpreted random sample points to compute bias-corrected area estimates. We also delineate an indicative impact zone of pollution proportional to the density of galamsey, assuming a maximum radius of 10 km. In the cocoa growing area of Ghana, the estimated total area of galamsey in 2013 is 27,839 ha with an impact zone of 551,496 ha. In the change area, galamsey has more than tripled between 2011 and 2015, resulting in 603 ha of direct encroachment into protected forest reserves. Assuming the same growth rate for the rest of the cocoa growing area, the total area of galamsey in 2015 is estimated at 43,879 ha. Galamsey is developing along most of the river network (Offln, Ankobra, Birim, Anum, Tano), with downstream pollution affecting both land and water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Global initiatives such as REDD+ are receiving growing investments, and in-country policy makers are under pressure to protect intact forests. In 2008, Brazil met these pressures by making deforestation reduction a central piece of its climate change policy. Although previous research found that this policy led to reduced deforestation, decreases in fire-another significant factor in carbon emissions-were not observed. Here we revisit Amazonia, the target location of Brazil's anti-deforestation policies, to determine how precipitation may be affecting forest fires in the area while controlling for other potential biophysical, economic, and institutional correlates. Using data on precipitation and deforestation alongside MODIS active fire and burned area data, this article examines the general spatial-temporal trends of fire in the region between 2001 and 2013. We then implements statistical models to measure the relative impact of precipitation and anti-deforestation policies on both fire events and burned area over the time period. The analysis shows that while deforestation decreased under policy treatment, forest fires were less responsive to policies. Furthermore, the analysis provides strong evidence for the existence of a precipitation effect on both fire events and burned area. Results indicate that a one standard deviation decrease in precipitation from its normal could increase fire events by 11-15% and burned area by 18-27%. The article concludes by addressing the challenges in controlling fire in Amazonia under drier climatic conditions in the presence of abundant fuel and ignition sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, nitrogen loss could result in the reduction of nutrient value of the compost products and the stabilization effect of composting on heavy metal concentration and mobility in sludge has been shown to be very limited. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of bamboo charcoal (BC) on nitrogen conservation and mobility of Cu and Zn during sludge composting. The result indicated that the incorporation of BC into the sludge composting material could significantly reduce nitrogen loss. With 9% BC amendment, total nitrogen loss at the end of composting decreased 64.1% compared with no BC amendment (control treatment). Mobility of Cu and Zn in the sludge may also have been lessened, based on the decline in diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-extractable Cu and Zn contents of composted sludge by 44.4% and 19.3%, respectively, compared to metal extractability in the original material. Ammonia adsorption capability of BC might be the main reason for the retention of nitrogen in sludge composting materials. Decrease of extractable Cu2+ and Zn2+ in the composting material mainly resulted from the adsorption of both metals by BC. Incorporation of BC into composting material could significantly lessen the total nitrogen loss during sludge composting. Mobility of heavy metals in the sludge composting material could also be reduced by the addition of BC. Bamboo charcoal could be an effective amendment for nitrogen conservation and heavy metal stabilization in sludge composts. Further research into the effect of BC-amended sludge compost material on soil properties, bioavailability of heavy metals, and nutrient turnover in soil needs to be carried out prior to the application of BC-sludge compost in agriculture.","[Hua, Li; Wu, Weixiang; Liu, Yuxue; Chen, Yingxu] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [McBride, Murray B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Wu, WX (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",weixiang@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,161,186,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2009.0,16.0,1,,,,1,9,,10.1007/s11356-008-0041-0,,,,,,,,WOS:000262312900001,

However, large uncertainties currently exist concerning the quantities of C and other elements lost to the atmosphere due to the conversion of primary forests to pastures and agricultural lands. Elemental losses associated with land conversion in the heavily deforested Los Tuxtlas Region of Mexico were quantified. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) as well as carbon and nutrient pools in aboveground vegetation and soils were measured along a land-use gradient that included primary forests as well as pastures and cornfields, which represent the dominant land-use types in the region. TAGB of primary forests in the Los Tuxtlas Region averaged 403 Mg/ha; pasture and cornfield sites averaged 24 and 23 Mg/ha, respectively. Approximately 80% of TAGB of forests was composed of trees >30 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh), while trees >70 cm dbh accounted for 44% of TAGB. Conversion of forests to pastures or cornfields resulted in declines of 95% of aboveground C pools, 91% of aboveground N pools, 83% of aboveground P pools, and 89-95% of aboveground S pools in sites ranging in age from 3 to 45 years since deforestation. In contrast to aboveground pools, soil pools of C, N, and S to a 1 m depth were highly variable and did not show detectable declines in pasture and cornfield sites compared to forest sites, nor did they decline with increasing periods of land use. Average C mass in soils of forest, pasture, and cornfield sites rang ed between 166 and 210 Mg/ha; mass of N and S in soils ranged from 16 to 20 and from similar to 3 to 4 Mg/ha, respectively. Approximately 50% of the combined aboveground and soil pools of C were lost as a result of deforestation and land use. Because the vast majority (>90%) of N and S pools were present in the relatively stable pools of these young volcanic soils, less than 10% of combined aboveground and soil N and S pools were lost due to land-use change in the Los Tuxtlas Region.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Recuros Nat, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico",,"Hughes, RF (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Campus Box 216, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",hughesf@terra.colorado.edu,,,,,,,84,97,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2000.0,10.0,2,,,,515,527,,10.2307/2641111,,,,,,,,WOS:000086008300017,

This goal can be achieved by applying fertilisers (particularly P) in combination with seeding N-fixing legumes. However, the effect of this strategy on other key restoration goals such as the establishment and growth of non-leguminous species has received little attention. We investigated the effects of P-application rates either singly, or in combination with seeding seven large understorey legume species, on jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining. Five years after P application and seeding, legume species richness, density and cover were higher in the legume-seeded treatment. However, the increased establishment of legumes did not lead to increased soil N. Increasing P-application rates from 0 to 80 kg P ha(-1) did not affect legume species richness, but significantly reduced legume density and increased legume cover: cover was maximal (similar to 50%) where 80 kg P ha(-1) had been applied with large legume seeds. Increasing P-application had no effect on species richness of non-legume species, but increased the density of weeds and native ephemerals. Cover of non-legume species decreased with increasing P-application rates and was lower in plots where large legumes had been seeded compared with non-seeded plots. There was a significant legume x P interaction on weed and ephemeral density: at 80 kg P ha(-1) the decline in density of these groups was greatest where legumes were seeded. In addition, the decline in cover for non-legume species with increasing P was greatest when legumes were seeded. Applying 20 kg P ha(-1) significantly increased tree growth compared with tree growth in unfertilised plots, but growth was not increased further at 80 kg ha(-1) and tree growth was not affected by seeding large legumes. Taken together, these data indicate that 80 kg ha(-1) P-fertiliser in combination with (seeding) large legumes maximised vegetation cover at five years but could be suboptimal for re-establishing a jarrah forest community that, like unmined forest, contains a diverse community of slow-growing re-sprouter species. The species richness and cover of non-legume understorey species, especially the resprouters, was highest in plots that received either 0 or 20 kg ha(-1) P and where large legumes had not been seeded. Therefore, our findings suggest that moderation of P-fertiliser and legumes could be the best strategy to fulfil the multiple restoration goals of establishing vegetation cover, while at the same time maximising tree growth and species richness of restored forest.

We used three data sets to estimate stem number, basal area, and AGBM over a 600-ha old-growth TRF landscape (La Selva, N.E. Costa Rica). We analyzed the effects of soil type, slope angle, topographic position, and different sample designs and measurement techniques on these estimates. All three data sets were for woody stems greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter. Estimated AGBM was determined from stand-level measurements using Brown's (Brown, 1997) allometric equation for Tropical Wet: Forest trees. One data set was from three subjectively-sited 4-ha plots (the 'OTS plots'), another was based on 1170 0.01 ha plots spaced on a regular grid (the 'Vegetation map plots'), and the third was from 18 0.5 ha plots (the 'Carbono plots') sited to provide unbiased samples of three edaphic conditions: hat inceptisol old alluvial terraces; Rat ultisol hill-tops; and steep ultisol slopes. Basal area, estimated AGBM and the contributions of major life forms were similar among studies, in spite of the differences in sampling design and measurement techniques. Although the Carbono plots on Rat inceptisols had significantly larger and fewer trees than those on ultisols, AGBM did not vary over the relatively small edaphic gradient in upland areas at La Selva. On residual soils, the largest trees were on the flattest topographic positions. Slope angle per se was not correlated with basal area or AGBM within the residual soils. Errors introduced by palm and liana lift: forms, as well as hollow trees, did not significantly affect AGBM estimates. In contrast, the methods used to measure buttressed trees had a large impact. Plot sizes of 0.35-0.5 ha were sufficient to achieve coefficients of variation of <12% for basal area with only six replicates in a given edaphic type. AGBM estimates ranged from 161 to 186 Mg/ha. These low values appear to be mainly due to the Tropical Wet Forest allometry equation used. This in turn may be indicative of a real and substantially lower ratio of biomass/basal area in Tropical Wet Forest than in Tropical Moist, as previously noted by Brown (1996). Our results indicate that for upland TRF landscapes with levels of environmental variation similar to La Selva, AGBM will be relatively insensitive to soil type and topography. However, because topography and soil type had much stronger effects on stem size, stand density, and spatial heterogeneity of sterns, stand dynamics may be more sensitive than AGBM to this range of conditions. We recommend that future studies of landscape-scale forest structure employ stratified sampling designs across major environmental gradients. Unbiased sampling with replication, combined with consistent and well-documented measurement techniques, will lead to a greatly improved understanding of the magnitude of and reasons for variation in forest structure and AGBM within TRF landscapes.

Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations at T = 300 K (ca. 0.62 kcal/mol) revealed the presence of configurations with hydrogenbonded networks that include the OH moiety in CH3HgOH and exclude both the Hg and Cl in CH3HgCl, favoring a clathrate-type structure around the methyl moiety. The comparison to the microsolvated HgClOH, Hg(OH)(2), and HgCl2 molecules showed that, in all cases, the water molecules easily move away from Cl, thus supporting the idea that HgCl2 behaves as a non-polar solute.

In riverine Amazonia the significance of physical accessibility for biodiversity, land use patterns and economic livelihoods is widely acknowledged, but attempts to quantify accessibility in practice have been few in number. In this study we compare different distance- and frequency-based measures of spatial accessibility and develop a quantitative model of accessibility patterns for the north-eastern Peruvian Amazonia where rivers form the core of the transportation network. We model accessibility between the rural areas of the Loreto region and the capital city of Iquitos, using different distance algorithms in a geographic information system, and complement the distance model with information on river boat frequencies and transport capacities. Patterns of accessibility are visualized in terms of potential production zones for different types of agricultural and non-timber forest products. This study demonstrates how results from different accessibility measures vary considerably. The mean Euclidean distance to Iquitos is almost 270 km, the mean network distance nearly 760 km and the mean travel time 70 h. Observed network distances from validation points to Iquitos are on average 1.6 times longer than Euclidean distances, and for the whole study area, the average ratio between modeled network distances and Euclidean distances is 3.1. The correlation between network distances and time distances is very strong, but time distances are relatively shorter along the major channels where boat traffic is considerably faster than along narrow, tightly meandering rivers. Measures of boat frequency and transport capacity show that availability of transport possibilities is highly varying across the region. These measures provide insights into the 'thickness' of trade, indicating the level of market integration for riverine settlements. We conclude that quantifying accessibility in an environment like Peruvian Amazonia requires measures that take into account the spatial structure and dynamic nature of the riverine transportation network. Time as a unit of distance provides the most relevant measure of accessibility in the Amazonian context, where many human actions and traditional livelihoods are controlled by travel times between the regional core and the hinterland.

The calculated flux includes only that portion of the flux resulting from direct human activity. In most regions, activities included the conversion of natural ecosystems to cultivated lands and pastures, including shifting cultivation, harvest of wood (for timber and fuel) and the establishment of tree plantations. In the US, woody encroachment and woodland thickening as a result of fire suppression were also included. The calculated flux of carbon does not include increases or decreases in carbon storage as a result of environmental changes (e.g., increasing concentrations of CO2, N deposition, climatic change or pollution). Globally, the long-term (1850-2000) flux of carbon from changes in land use and management released 156 PgC to the atmosphere, about 60% of it from the tropics. Average annual fluxes during the 1980s and 1990s were 2.0 and 2.2 PgC yr(-1), respectively, dominated by releases of carbon from the tropics. Outside the tropics, the average net flux of carbon attributable to land-use change and management decreased from a source of 0.06 PgC yr(-1) during the 1980s to a sink of 0.02 PgC yr(-1) during the 1990s. According to the analyses summarized here, changes in land use were responsible for sinks in North America and Europe and for small sources in other non-tropical regions. The revisions were as large as 0.3 PgC yr(-1) in individual regions but were largely offsetting, so that the global estimate for the 1980s was changed little from an earlier estimate. Uncertainties and recent improvements in the data used to calculate the flux of carbon from land-use change are reviewed, and the results are compared to other estimates of flux to evaluate the extent to which processes other than land-use change and management are important in explaining changes in terrestrial carbon storage.","Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,"Houghton, RA (corresponding author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, POB 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",,,,,,,,767,858,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2003.0,55.0,2,,,,378,390,,10.1034/j.1600-0889.2003.01450.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000182698400028,

Inclusion of coastal ecosystems in mitigation strategies requires quantification of carbon stocks in order to calculate emissions or sequestration through time. In this study, we quantified the ecosystem C stocks of coastal wetlands of the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve (SKBR) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We stratified the SKBR into different vegetation types (tall, medium and dwarf mangroves, and marshes), and examined relationships of environmental variables with C stocks. At nine sites within SKBR, we quantified ecosystem C stocks through measurement of above and belowground biomass, downed wood, and soil C. Additionally, we measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the soil and interstitial salinity. Tall mangroves had the highest C stocks (987 +/- 338 Mg ha(-1)) followed by medium mangroves (623 +/- 41 Mg ha(-1)), dwarf mangroves (381 +/- 52 Mg ha(-1)) and marshes (177 +/- 73 Mg ha(-1)). At all sites, soil C comprised the majority of the ecosystem C stocks (78-99%). Highest C stocks were measured in soils that were relatively low in salinity, high in P and low in N: P, suggesting that P limits C sequestration and accumulation potential. In this karstic area, coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, are important C stocks. At the landscape scale, the coastal wetlands of Sian Ka'an covering approximate to 172,176 ha may store 43.2 to 58.0 million Mg of C.","[Adame, Maria Fernanda; Medina, Israel; Gamboa, Julieta N.; Caamal, Juan P.; Herrera-Silveira, Jorge A.] Inst Politecn Nacl CINVESTAV IPN, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados CINVESTAV, Merida, Mexico; [Adame, Maria Fernanda] Griffith Univ Brisbane, Australian Rivers Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kauffman, J.

Remote sensing has considerable potential to provide such maps, but classification accuracy within primary rain forests has generally been inadequate for practical applications. Here we test how accurately floristically defined forest types in lowland tropical rain forests in Peruvian Amazonia can be recognized using remote sensing data (Landsat ETM+ satellite image and STRM elevation model). Floristic data and a vegetation classification with four forest classes were available for eight line transects, each 8 km long, located in an area of ca 800 km. We compared two sampling unit sizes (line transect subunits of 200 and 500 m) and several image feature combinations to analyze their suitability for image classification. Mantel tests were used to quantify how well the patterns in elevation and in the digital numbers of the satellite image correlated with the floristic patterns observed in the field. Most Mantel correlations were positive and highly significant. Linear discriminant analysis was used first to build a function that discriminates between forest classes in the eight field-verified transects on the basis of remotely sensed data, and then to classify those parts of the line transects and the satellite image that had not been visited in the field. Classification accuracy was quantified by 8-fold crossvalidation. Two of the tierra firme (non-inundated) forest types were combined because they were too often misclassified. The remaining three forest types (inundated forest, terrace forest and Pebas formation/intermediate tierra firme forest) could be separated using the 500-m sampling units with an overall classification accuracy of 85% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.62. For the 200-m sampling units, the classification accuracy was clearly lower (71%, Kappa 0.35). The forest classification will be used as habitat data to study wildlife habitat use in the same area. Our results show that remotely sensed data and relatively simple classification methods can be used to produce reasonably accurate forest type classifications, even in structurally homogeneous primary rain forests.

Most of that population resides in the rural communities in developing countries in South Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to electricity can eliminate existing problems related to health, education, social life, economy and the environment, and can increase the income of underserved communities. Most of the yet to be energized regions are in remote, isolated areas, that cannot be serviced through the central grid. While decentralized diesel generators can potentially be installed in these areas, they have a poor effect on climate change mitigation. Clean renewable energy alternatives for off-grid systems are being deployed to reduce the non-electrification rate in the world, and The United Nation Foundation's 2030 Agenda has the objective of universal access to electricity by 2030. While there has been some progress towards that goal, the challenges are countless. If no changes in models, policies and practices are made, the universal access objective will not be achieved, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa that has a level of electrification projection of 30% by 2030. To determine the necessary changes, this paper reviews the rural electrification initiatives in eight developing countries, from Asia to Sub-Saharan Africa to Latin America, and aims to provide an assessment of their success and to discuss the lessons that can be learned and applied on future initiatives.","[Almeshqab, Fatema] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Ustun, Taha Selim] AIST FREA, Fukushima Renewable Energy Inst, Koriyama, Fukushima, Japan",,"Almeshqab, F (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",falmeshq@andrew.cmu.edu,,,,,,,46,47,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2019.0,102.0,,,,,35,53,,10.1016/j.rser.2018.11.035,,,,,,,,WOS:000455404000004,

Evidence from history is cited to illustrate these effects, and the implications for resource-based development in the Contemporary Era (1950 to present) are discussed.

This research presents the development of a multi-model approach for assessing forest growth and biomass accumulation within the wet tropics bioregion (WTB) based on 10 years of available data and existing model parameter sets. The Tropical Rainforest Growth (TRG) model system employs the 3-PG and 3-PGS models to account for both old-growth rainforest and forest regeneration from seedlings in response to human-induced and natural disturbances. Above-ground biomass (AGB) stocks of the mature forest throughout the WTB for 2000 were estimated to be similar to 202 t C/ha. Replacement of areas of old-growth with commercial timber plantations decreased overall AGB stocks to approximately 146 t C/ha. However, plantation carbon accumulation rates were higher than the mature rainforest, representing their potential to accumulate more biomass over a longer analysis time period. As tropical cyclones may significantly alter the carbon stocks of old-growth rainforests, the effect of tropical cyclone Rona on the WTB was assessed. The cyclone had a minimal impact on total AGB stocks within the region, yet these systems are an important factor to be considered in carbon and forest regeneration modelling activities in the tropics. The TRG system is an advanced modelling tool providing a rapid process-based assessment of biomass stocks and accumulation dynamics within Australia's tropical rainforest bioregion and has the potential for application in tropical forest ecosystems at both national and international levels.

In the heavily deforested Los Tuxtlas Region of Mexico, aboveground biomass as well as aboveground and mineral soil C, N, S, and P pools were quantified in Il secondary forest sites. These sites ranged in age from 6 mo to 50 yr following abandonment and had experienced between 1 and 30 yr of land use prior to abandonment. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) increased with increasing site age and ranged from 4.8 Mg/ha in a recently abandoned site to 287 Mg/ha in the 50-yr-old secondary forest site. Results indicate that secondary forests would reach TAGB levels equivalent to those of primary forests in the Los Tuxtlas Region after 73 yr. Furthermore, mean annual aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) of secondary forests was strongly and inversely related to the duration of prior land use. Aboveground pools of C, N, S, and P were also positively correlated with secondary forest age. For forests between 6 mo and 50 yr of age, C pools increased from 2 to 136 Mg/ha, N increased from 72 to 1167 kg/ha, S increased from 9 to 147 kg/ha, and P increased from 5 to 147 kg/ha. In contrast, C, N, and S pools in mineral soil to a l-m depth remained relatively stable throughout the successional chronosequence and averaged 207, 20, and 3.4 Mg/ha, respectively.

Dynamics of the combined aboveground and mineral soil C pools (i.e., excluding C in root biomass) were characterized by increasing contributions from aboveground pools with increasing forest age; aboveground C pools accounted for 9% and 42% of the combined pool in the youngest and oldest forests, respectively. In contrast, changes in combined aboveground and mineral soil pools of N and S during secondary succession were relatively small because >90% of N and S mass was located in mineral soil pools.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Recursos Nat, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico",,"Hughes, RF (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Box 216, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",hugh-esf@hypatia.colorado.edu,,,,,,,249,276,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,1999.0,80.0,6,,,,1892,1907,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082408300010,

On a global scale, new patterns of resource exploration, extraction, and commodification create new territories. This takes place within a dynamic of frontiers and territorialization. Frontier dynamics dissolve existing social orders property systems, political jurisdictions, rights, and social contracts whereas territorialization is shorthand for all the dynamics that establish them and re-order space anew. Frontier moments offer new opportunities, and old social contracts give way to struggles over new ones. As new types of resource commodification emerge, institutional orders are sometimes undermined or erased, and sometimes reinterpreted, reinvented, and recycled. New property regimes, new forms of authority, and the attendant struggles for legitimacy over the ability to define proper uses and users follow frontier moments. The drawing of borders and the creation of orders around new resources profoundly rework patterns of authority and institutional architectures. We argue that the territorialization of resource control is a set of processes that precedes legitimacy and authority, fundamentally challenging and replacing existing patterns of spatial control, authority, and institutional orders. It is dynamics of this sort that the articles in this collection explore: the outcomes produced in the frontier space, the kinds of authority that emerge through control over space and the people in it, and the battles for legitimacy that this entails. This collection explores the emergence of frontier spaces, arguing that these are transitional, liminal spaces in which existing regimes of resource control are suspended, making way for new ones.

However, in order to ensure that ACTs are correctly used and are accessible to the poor and remote communities who need them, specific interventions will be necessary and the additional costs need to be considered. Methods: This paper presents an incremental cost analysis of some of these interventions in Cambodia, the first country to change national antimalarial drug policy to an ACT of artesunate and mefloquine. These costs include the cost of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), the cost of blister-packaging the drugs locally and the costs of increasing access to diagnosis and treatment to remote communities through malaria outreach teams (MOTs) and Village Malaria Workers (VMW). Results: At optimum productive capacity, the cost of blister-packaging cost under $0.20 per package but in reality was significantly more than this because of the low rate of production. The annual fixed cost (exclusive of RDTs and drugs) per capita of the MOT and VMW schemes was $0.44 and $0.69 respectively. However because the VMW scheme achieved a higher rate of coverage than the MOT scheme, the cost per patient treated was substantially lower at $5.14 compared to $12.74 per falciparum malaria patient treated. The annual cost inclusive of the RDTs and drugs was $19.31 for the MOT scheme and $11.28 for the VMW scheme given similar RDT positivity rates of around 22% and good provider compliance to test results. Conclusion: In addition to the cost of ACTs themselves, substantial additional investments are required in order to ensure that they reach the targeted population via appropriate delivery systems and to ensure that they are used appropriately. In addition, differences in local conditions, in particular the prevalence of malaria and the pre-existing infrastructure, need to be considered in choosing appropriate diagnostic and delivery strategies.","[Yeung, Shunmay; Mills, Anne] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hlth Policy Unit, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Yeung, Shunmay; White, Nicholas J.] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Wellcome Trust Mahidol Univ Oxford Trop Med Res P, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Van Damme, Wim] Inst Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Socheat, Duong] Natl Ctr Parasitol Entomol & Malaria Control, Phnom Penh, Cambodia",,"Yeung, S (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hlth Policy Unit, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",shunmay.yeung@lshtm.ac.uk; wvdamme@itg.be; socheatd@cnm.gov.kh; nickwdt@tropmedres.ac; anne.mills@lshtm.ac.uk,,,,,,,23,23,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 20,2008.0,7.0,,,,,,,84,10.1186/1475-2875-7-84,,,,,,,,WOS:000256481500002,

This emission represents 1.5 % of the yearly CO2-emission from Swedish electricity combustion plants. Thus, the CO2-emission from Swedish hydropower is much lower per unit of electricity produced than the emission front Swedish combustion plants. Emission of CO2 from Swedish reservoirs was lower than from most reservoirs in other boreal regions of the world.

The majority of these gold mining operations utilize mercury (Hg) amalgamation methods in the recovery process, raising the question as to the significance of Hg inputs to the environment from mining activities. In March and April, 2001, 168 samples were collected from floodplain, sand bar, and channel bed deposits along a 350 km reach of the Mazaruni River and a 160 km reach of the Essequibo River. Distinct trends in the geochemical data suggest that much of the Hg found in the alluvial deposits is related to anthropogenic sources, including (1) Hg concentrations in floodplain, channel bed and sand bar deposits locally exceed background values defined by ferralitic soils; (2) core data reveal that Hg concentrations within floodplain deposits have increased in recent years; and (3) high Hg concentrations along the channels can be attributed to the influx of material from tributaries affected by mining operations, or to mining activities along the rivers. Recent investigations in Amazonia have argued that Hg from amalgamation mining represents a small portion of the total Hg load to riverine systems, the majority coming from the erosion of Hg enriched upland soils within deforested terrain. Geochemical data from the Essequibo and Mazaruni Rivers suggest that Hg from mining may be a more significant source in Guyana where large-scale deforestation is limited. However, it is unclear whether the increased Hg represents the direct input associated with the amalgamation process, or Hg associated with the erosion of soils and sediments that results from activities that accompany mining.","Western Carolina Univ, Dept Geosci & Nat Resources Management, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA; Univ Nevada, Nevada Bur Mines & Geol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog, Norman, OK 73019 USA",,"Miller, JR (corresponding author), Western Carolina Univ, Dept Geosci & Nat Resources Management, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA.",jmiller@wcu.edu,,,,,,,36,38,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2003.0,148.0,1-4,,,,139,166,,10.1023/A:1025465800121,,,,,,,,WOS:000184990800011,

Given the biological and genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi, the high morbidity, mortality, and the observed therapeutic failure, new characteristics of these outbreaks need to be addressed at different levels, both in Trypanosoma cruzi as in patient response. The aim of this work was to evaluate the patient's features involved in six outbreaks of acute Chagas disease which occurred in Santander, Colombia, and the characteristics of Trypanosoma cruzi clones isolated from these patients, to establish the potential relationship between the etiologic agent features with host behavior. Methods: The clinical, pathological and epidemiological aspects of outbreaks were analyzed. In addition, Trypanosoma cruzi clones were biologically characterized both in vitro and in vivo, and the susceptibility to the classical trypanocidal drugs nifurtimox and benznidazole was evaluated. Trypanosoma cruzi clones were genotyped by means of mini-exon intergenic spacer and cytochrome b genes sequencing. Results: All clones were DTU I, and based on the mini-exon intergenic spacer, belong to two genotypes: G2 related with sub-urban, and G11 with rural outbreaks. Giron outbreak clones with higher susceptibility to drugs presented G2 genotype and C/T transition in Cyt b. The outbreaks affected mainly young population (+/- 25.9 years), and the mortality rate was 10 %. The cardiac tissue showed intense inflammatory infiltrate, myocardial necrosis and abundant amastigote nests. However, although the gastrointestinal tissue was congestive, no inflammation or parasites were observed. Conclusions: Although all clones belong to DTU I, two intra-DTU genotypes were found with the sequencing of the mini-exon intergenic spacer, however there is no strict correlation between genetic groups, the cycles of the parasite or the clinical forms of the disease. Trypanosoma cruzi clones from Giron with higher sensitivity to nifurtimox presented a particular G2 genotype and C/T transition in Cyt b. When the diagnosis was early, the patients responded well to antichagasic treatment, which highlights the importance of diagnosis and treatment early to prevent fatal outcomes associated with these acute episodes.","[Lucia Diaz, Martha; Cesar Mantilla, Julio; Gonzalez Rugeles, Clara Isabel] Univ Ind Santander, Fac Salud, GIEM, Bucaramanga, Colombia; [Leal, Sandra; Escobar, Patricia] Univ Ind Santander, Escuela Med, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Grp Invest Enfermedades Trop CINTROP, Bucaramanga, Colombia; [Solari, Aldo] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Inst Ciencias Biomed, Programa Biol Celular & Mol, Santiago, Chile; [Molina-Berrios, Alfredo; Lopez-Munoz, Rodrigo] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Inst Ciencias Biomed, Programa Farmacol Mol & Clin, Santiago, Chile; [Gonzalez Rugeles, Clara Isabel] Univ Ind Santander, Fac Salud, Escuela Microbiol, Bucaramanga, Colombia",,"Rugeles, CIG (corresponding author), Univ Ind Santander, Fac Salud, GIEM, Bucaramanga, Colombia.",cig@uis.edu.co,,,,,,,5,6,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 26,2015.0,8.0,,,,,,,608,10.1186/s13071-015-1218-2,,,,,,,,WOS:000365505800002,

Spiked and unspiked aquatic plants (Typha domingensis) and CRMs certified for Total-Hg (BCR-60, BCR-482 and NCS ZC73027, corresponding to aquatic plant, lichen and rice, respectively) have been used. Under the final optimized conditions the simultaneous determination of MMHg and inorganic Hg can be carried out in less than 40 min with no tedious clean-up steps. Quantitative recoveries (from 92% to 101%) were obtained in aquatic plants (Typha domingensis) and CRMs spiked with known concentrations of MMHg. For unspiked BCR-60 and BCR-482, no statistically significant differences (p=0.05) were found in Total-Hg concentrations between those obtained by the sum of species and the certified values for both acid and alkaline extraction. For the analysis of low Hg polluted samples, an additional preconcentration step by evaporation under nitrogen stream was required but adequate blanks were only obtained for acid extraction. Detection limits in the low ng/g range (0.7-1.0 ng/g) were consequently achieved for both Hg species in the case of acid extraction and the analysis of NCS ZC73027 gave satisfactory results without statistically significant differences between the found and certified values (p = 0.05).","[Jimenez-Moreno, Maria; Rodriguez Martin-Doimeadios, Rosa Carmen] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Environm Sci Inst ICAM, Dept Analyt Chem & Food Technol, Ave Carlos 3 S-N, E-45071 Toledo, Spain; [Angel Lominchar, Miguel; Jose Sierra, Maria; Millan, Rocio] CIEMAT Environm Dept, Ave Complutense 40, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,"Martin-Doimeadios, RCR (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Environm Sci Inst ICAM, Dept Analyt Chem & Food Technol, Ave Carlos 3 S-N, E-45071 Toledo, Spain.",RosaCarmen.Rodriguez@uclm.es,,,,,,,19,20,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 1,2018.0,176.0,,,,,102,107,,10.1016/j.talanta.2017.08.015,,,,,,,,WOS:000412610100014,

Remote sensing-based estimate of impervious surface area (ISA) has emerged as an important indicator for the assessment of water resources depletion in urban areas and developed a correlation between land-use change and their potential impact on urban hydrology. In the present work, a remote sensing-based Impervious Surface Area (ISA) was carried out for New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) city, one of the fastest growing cities in National Capital Region (NCR) of India. The impervious surface area (ISA) of NOIDA was calculated for the years 2001, 2007 and 2014 using multi-temporal LANDSAT thermal data by applying linear spectral mixing analysis (LSMA) techniques to monitor the growth rate of impervious surface. The results observed by analysis of multi-temporal satellite images show an extreme temporal change in the growth of ISA in the city. The ISA observed for the year 2001 is 28 sq.km; in 2007, its increase was 48 sq. km and was 132 in 2014. The results were observed from this work through the use of satellite data which is very important for water resource management, planning and prediction of ISA impact on hydrology.","[Chaudhuri, Anindita Sarkar; Singh, Prafull] Amity Univ, Amity Inst Geoinformat & Remote Sensing, Sect 125, Noida 201303, India; [Rai, S.

Two types of anthropogenic dark earths (ADEs) were identified: terra preta (TP: darkened with charcoal fragments and with abundant pottery shards) and terra mulata (TM: somewhat darkened but with little or no pottery). In 216 ha, we compared the densities of trees > 10 cm dbh of useful species in nine TP patches, three TM patches, and six areas with nonanthropogenic soils (N-ADE). The TP, which covers approximately 20 percent of the sample area, has higher contents of organic matter, extractable P, and extractable Ca than N-ADE soils, as well as higher pH and extractable P than TM. TM has organic matter and Ca contents similar to N-ADE soils but significantly less extractable K. In general, TP has higher nutrient content than surrounding soils, both at the surface (0-10 cm) and deeper in the profile (40-50 cm). Despite these differences in soil fertility and contrary to our expectations, none of the 17 tree species were concentrated on TP perhaps because interactions between local dispersal agents and natural disturbances have masked historical patterns. Alternatively, past inhabitants of the study area may have enriched forests with useful tree species in areas where they were not practicing the intensive soil husbandry that results in ADEs.","[Putz, Francis E.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Paz-Rivera, Clea] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Putz, FE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, POB 118526, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",fep@ufl.edu,,,,,,,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2009.0,41.0,6,,,,665,675,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00521.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000271627600008,

In this paper, we draw on a unique dataset of landholder reported land transactions that includes post-1991 land sales-in three sub-montane frontier forest areas on the eastern slopes of the Peruvian Andes. We analyze reported land sales that took place between 1979 and 2013 among Amazonian frontier farmers and find highly active land markets in all three areas, often in the absence of formal land tenure. As frontiers developed, parcel size fell, as did the portion of remaining forest cover, and land prices rose, reflecting both forest clearing and general land price inflation as the areas became more populated and developed. Across three study districts in 2013, each additional hectare of forest cleared raised the expected price of a parcel of land by US $1371-$2587. Importantly, we estimate the opportunity cost per hectare of frontier forest rose markedly over time: by $124-$226 per year between 2003 and 2013, a rate of increase over that period of 9-27% per year.

In this paper, we apply Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data to the monitoring of seasonal changes in atmospheric water vapor, liquid water, and surface cover in the vicinity of the Jasper Ridge, CA, for three dates in 1992. Apparent surface reflectance was retrieved and water vapor and liquid water mapped by using a radiative-transfer-based inversion that accounts for spatially variable atmospheres. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was used to model reflectance data as mixtures of green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), soil, and shade. Temporal and spatial patterns in endmember fractions and liquid water were compared to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The reflectance retrieval algorithm was tested by using a temporally invariant target. Atmospheric analysis showed a strongly negative linear between water vapor and elevation with significant seasonal variation in water vapor. Comparison of AVIRIS estimates of specific humidity to ground-based measures showed good correspondence for all three dates. Analysis of surface properties showed that GV, NDVI, and liquid water varied in response to green vegetation and were highly correlated. However, whereas the NDVI peaked between 0.7 and 0.85 in forests, liquid water continued to vary by as much as a factor of two. Seasonal patterns included senescence in herbaceous and nonconiferous vegetation, potential leaf growth in coniferous forests, and a general increase in shadows. This resulted in seasonal declines in NDVI, GV, and liquid water for nonforested vegetation and increases in NPV. Nonconiferous forests showed similar declines in liquid water and GV and increases in shade and NPV, but they showed an increase in NDVI. In coniferous forests, liquid water and NDVI increased seasonally, matching an interpretation of continued growth, but GV decreased owing to increased shade. The combination of retrieved surface reflectance, atmospheric modeling, and mapping of liquid water demonstrates the utility of imaging spectrometry for change detection. SMA with the use of reference end-members is an effective method for monitoring surficial changes. Temporal patterns in NDVI that contradict trends of GV and liquid water in nonconiferous forests raise additional questions about the NDVI. Liquid water may be more appropriate for analysis of high-leaf-area, shadowed forests because it overcomes the problem of saturation with NDVI.

In the Bayano-Darien agricultural frontier of Panama, this paper observes forest-cover expansion that is simultaneous to and successive of a preceding pattern of land-use/cover change characterized by expanding ranchland and depopulation. Landsat TM satellite-imagery analysis for 1990-2000, household land-use histories since 2000 and forest plantation records for 1992-2007 illustrate reforestation occurring alongside deforestation. The findings describe a land-cover change dynamic by which a nascent pathway of reforestation assumes the characteristics of antecedent pathways of deforestation. Large-scale commercial interests dominated forestation via plantation expansion, succeeding and consolidating ranchers as ranchers previously succeeded small-scale agriculturalists. Contrary to the forest-transition theory, off-farm employment and emigration did not encourage reforestation amongst ranchers. The drivers, nature, likelihood and limitations of a nascent forest transition appear somewhat determinable by antecedent pathways of deforestation. Refocusing on regional-scale antecedent pathways of land-use/cover change promises to expose a typology of forest transitions of varied potency. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous studies note a dynamism surrounding reforestation, however, including associations with forest loss. Such apparent contradictions were recently underscored by descriptions of Latin American 'reforestation reversals' - marked declines in forest cover following net reforestation. Reversals arguably challenge classical perspectives on forest transitions while predominating within regional foresttransition epicenters. Potential reversal dynamics, still subject to speculation, bring into focus the shortcoming of recent forest-transition scholarship, particularly its reliance on generic satellite observation and neglect of land-use transitions shaping, and sustaining, reforestation. To catalyze research in this domain, I explore reversals in relation to land-change dynamics commonly linked to reforestation. I further frame reversals as inherent features of emergent tropical forest transitions, advancing a 'pulsed' forest-transition model and emphasizing that apparent reversals may not entail waning reforestation trajectories. A greater embrace of systematic, historical case studies parsing reforestation between land use and disuse is key to a fuller understanding of both forest transitions and reversals.","[Sloan, Sean] Vancouver Isl Univ, Dept Geog, 900 Fifth St, Nanaimo, BC VR9 5S5, Canada",,"Sloan, S (corresponding author), Vancouver Isl Univ, Dept Geog, 900 Fifth St, Nanaimo, BC VR9 5S5, Canada.",sean.sloan@viu.ca,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022.0,112.0,,,,,,,105800,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105800,,,,,,,,WOS:000709962100007,

Understanding the sensitivity of these data is important since these phenomena are projected to increase as climate changes. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data were used to study the observed patterns of forest disturbance at different spatial scales in temperate forest (US Gulf Coast) produced by tropical cyclones Charley (2004), Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), and Gustav (2008), and in tropical rainforests (Australia) produced by cyclone Yasi (2011). The severity of forest disturbance was quantified by applying spectral mixture analysis to the MODIS and Landsat coverages. Field studies were used to verify and compare the results. At the local scale Landsat data was sensitive to forest disturbance both within and between forest types. Higher tree mortality was observed in tropical rainforests than in temperate forests. This observation may be explained by forest type characteristics such as stem density, forest adaptation, and depth of root systems. At the species level, Landsat showed a gradient of forest resilience to tropical cyclone winds that agreed with observational field studies. At the landscape scale, the observed topographic effects on disturbance patterns were well represented by the MODIS data. Positive covariance was observed between surface orientation and slope on the severity of disturbance. Greater levels of disturbance were observed on windward surfaces with steeper slopes. Finally, at the regional scale, MODIS reproduced the pattern of forest damage associated with cyclone winds. The highest level of forest disturbance was observed on the right side of the cyclone track in the northern hemisphere (US Gulf Coast forest ecosystems) and on the left side in the southern hemisphere (Australian rainforest). At the regional scale, forest disturbance was positively associated with the decrease of wind speeds in an inland direction. Tropical cyclone surface winds explained 20% of forest disturbance, although characteristics of cumulative processes could cause this to be underestimated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

National governments are building many of these roads, which are often perceived as disenfranchising Indigenous communities. Yet in the Canadian Arctic's Mackenzie Delta, a joint venture between two Indigenous-owned construction and transportation companies built the first public highway in North America to the Arctic Ocean, which opened in November 2017. This research, based on qualitative fieldwork in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region where the highway was constructed, challenges ideas that roads are invariably top-down initiatives which negatively impact Indigenous peoples and their lands. Inuvialuit community leaders lobbied for this road project and succeeded in winning CAD $299 million in government funding to construct the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway. They leveraged opportunities afforded by land claims treaties and shifting geopolitics in the warming Arctic, which turned their region into a frontier of renewed national and global interest, to accumulate funding. Strategically, they discursively rescaled a road they sought to promote economic development and improve local mobility between two communities into a highway of national importance. This study thus extends work on tribal capitalism to explore the place-based dynamics of Indigenous political economies. It unpacks the scale oriented strategies Indigenous peoples use to advocate for new roads and increased connectivity, finding that these discourses and practices can complement the state's promotion of nation-building and market capitalism in frontier spaces. This research also suggests that more attention is required to the circumstances in which Indigenous peoples initiate or become partners in infrastructure development rather than examining only instances of resistance.

In particular, mixed strain infections and reinfections have the potential to exacerbate disease progression subsequently affecting clinical management of patients with CD. Consequently, an associated reduction in therapeutic intervention and poor prognosis may occur due to this exacerbated disease state. This study investigated the effects of mixed strain infections and reinfection with Trypanosoma cruzi in mice, using two isolates from different discrete typing units, TcI (C8 clone 1) and TcIV (10R26). There were no significant differences in mortality rate, body weight or body condition among mice infected with either C8 clone 1, 10R26, or a mixture of both isolates. However, the parasite was found in a significantly greater number of host organs in mice infected with a mixture of isolates, and the histopathological response to infection was significantly greater in mice infected with C8 clone 1 alone, and C8 clone 1 + 10R26 mixed infections than in mice infected with 10R26 alone. To investigate the effects of reinfection, mice received either a double exposure to C8 clone 1; a double exposure to 10R26; exposure to C8 clone 1 followed by 10R26; or exposure to 10R26 followed by C8 done 1. Compared to single infection groups, mortality was significantly increased, while survival time, body weight and body condition were all significantly decreased across all reinfection groups, with no significant differences among these groups. The mortality rate over all reinfection groups was 63.6%, compared to 0% in single infection groups, however there was no evidence of a greater histopathological response to infection. These results suggest firstly, that the C8 clone 1 isolate is more virulent than the 10R26 isolate, and secondly, that a more disseminated infection may occur with a mixture of isolates than with single isolates, although there is no evidence that mixed infections have a greater pathological effect. By contrast, reinfections do have major effects on host survivability and thus disease outcome. This confirms previous research demonstrating spontaneous deaths following reinfection, a phenomenon that to our knowledge has only been reported once before.","[Perez, Catherine J.; Thompson, R. C.

Constructing reservoirs modifies the biogeochemical cycles, such as interrupting the flow of organic carbon, changing the nutrient balance, and altering oxygen and thermal conditions. The consequences of altered processes may not be immediately apparent and may become obvious only after a long period of time or only in combination with other anthropogenic alterations. It is difficult to give precise predictions of the impacts of a particular dam due to the complexity and individuality of aquatic ecosystems. However, this remains the challenge while planning and constructing new dams.

It is also difficult to estimate the cost of a transition to more sustainable land-management practices for individual landholders. The main cost to landholders is the opportunity costs, the income foregone when changing land use for continued or enhanced ecosystem service provision. Thus accurate estimation of opportunity costs and understanding their distribution are crucial starting points for determining the economic viability and design of any payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme. We compare two opportunity cost approaches and examine the distribution of these costs for improving drinking water quality in a complex farming system in a Honduran forest catchment. Data for both approaches was collected through a survey applied to upstream catchment landholders. Our results indicate that the direct flow approach and the proxy rent approach provide comparable and consistent opportunity cost estimates. The mean net flow return ha(-1) was US$1410, but this estimate was skewed, mainly by exceptionally high coffee returns and negative returns of land uses making a loss. This estimate would imply spending over US$ 2 million per annum for water conservation, but a revised estimate comes to US$ 257,057 per annum. Opportunity costs were found to vary according to differences in land use and landholder characteristics. High value cash crops upholding the local economy, such as coffee, entail much higher opportunity costs than for example cattle grazing. These results suggest that discriminate PES payments, that vary according to opportunity costs and thus discriminate between land uses and landholders, are essential. Water quality at our case study site could be managed sustainably by a scheme focusing on high-impact land uses with lower opportunity costs and closer to water sources.","[Rendon, Olivia R.; Dallimer, Martin; Paavola, Jouni] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",,"Rendon, OR (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,,2016.0,21.0,4,,,,,,36,10.5751/ES-08787-210436,,,,,,,,WOS:000391199400025,

Our pasture sites are relatively lightly managed, and total pools, of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were not significantly different from their forest counterparts. However, pools of available elements were different; most notably, plant available forms of P were significantly lower in the oxisol pasture than in the oxisol forest site. In addition, we found that land conversion led to fundamental changes in the size and activity of the soil microbial community. Microbial biomass was consistently higher in forests than in pastures, particularly in the oxisol sites, where it was more than twice the pasture value. Forest sites were also characterized by a microbial community that was more active, responded more rapidly to carbon substrate additions, and showed strong seasonal variation. Our results provide evidence that changes in biogeochemical cycling following land conversion observed here and elsewhere may be directly related to changes in microbial community structure and function.","Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Environm Populat & Organism Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Cleveland, CC (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Campus Box 450, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,,60,66,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2003.0,13.0,2,,,,314,326,,10.1890/1051-0761(2003)013[0314:SMDABI]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,WOS:000182669300004,

Studies have shown that tribal populations in India are also experiencing this burden. Objective: The aim was to estimate the pooled prevalence of primary hypertension among adult tribal populations of India. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, IndMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and major journals for studies published between 1981 and 2011. Two authors independently reviewed the studies, did quality assessment and extracted data in pre-coded spread-sheets. Pooled estimates of prevalence of hypertension were calculated using DerSimonian-Laird random effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were performed. Results: Twenty studies or 53 subpopulations with 64 674 subjects were included in final review. The pooled estimate of hypertension prevalence was 16.1% (95% CI: 13.5, 19.2). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies (I-2 = 99% and Q = 4624.0, df = 53, p, < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that year of study, acculturation status, special features, and BP measurement techniques significantly influenced prevalence, but after meta-regression analyses, 'decade of study' remained the only covariate that significantly and independently influenced prevalence (R 2 = 0.57, Q = 119.2, df = 49, p value,0.001). Conclusion: An increasing trend was found in the prevalence of hypertension in adult tribal populations across three decades. Although acculturation was probably the underlying agent that caused this increase, other unmeasured factors that need further research were also important. Concerned policy makers should focus on the changing health needs of tribal communities.","[Rizwan, S. A.; Singh, Arvind Kumar; Kusuma, Y.

To determine the area from which lianas colonize tree crowns in a liana-rich It moist lowland forest in a timber concession in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, we described liana sheds of individual canopy trees (the area under the crown and beyond its margins from which lianas colonize trees). In the same area we tested the hypothesis that pre-logging cutting of lianas in a harvested tree's liana shed reduces post-logging liana infestations. Prior to logging, 73% of 570 trees >10 cm in DBH representing 12 commercial species, carried at least one liana >2 cm DBH. Liana-infested trees hosted an average of 9.3 lianas (+/-0.45 S.E., range: 1-68). The mean area of the crown covered by lianas was 35% (+/-29.7 S.E.) but some trees (10%) were completely covered by lianas. Liana shed areas were a function of crown area and varied among tree species. Most lianas on trees were rooted below the crown of their host (90%); the number of lianas decreased with increasing distance from the crown edge, but,lianas colonized trees from as far as 8 m beyond the crown. Overall, there was a significant reduction in the number of lianas in 22 felling gaps 8 months after logging where lianas were cut before logging compared with 22 control gaps. In control gaps, the majority of climbing lianas sprouted from the prostrate stems of fallen canopy lianas (81%), including 3.1 km/ha of stems that were rooted along the ground before logging. Liana regeneration in gaps after pre-logging liana cutting occurred mainly by stump sprouting (41%) and sprouting from prostrate stems (48%). Pre-felling liana cutting reduced liana cover in felling gaps by 9% only but reduced liana basal area by 69%. The results of this study suggest that tree crown area, shape, and height are among the most important factors determining the likelihood of liana colonization of canopy trees and that pre-logging liana cutting reduces post-logging liana proliferation in logging gaps.

The goal was to construct a spatial typology of farming systems and assess their influence on the extent and spatial distribution of deforestation, forest re-growth, and agriculture expansion in southern Chile between 1999 and 2007. We present a farm typology and its spatial rendering through the combination of farm-cadastral information and land cover and change data. Using multivariate statistical methods, four types were identified. Type I (1565 subsistence farms) and type II farms (1016 multifunctional farms) comprised 94% of the total farms under study. Type III (28 forest farms) and type IV farms (137 specialized dairy farms) represented the remaining 6%, but accounted for 35% of the deforested area. Using Kernel density estimation, it was determined that areas of high deforestation density were related to high concentrations of type I and IV farms, whereas agriculture expansion was related to types I and II. Overall, subsistence farms had the largest influence on the landscape in terms of the spatial extent and concentration of LUCC processes.

The methodology combines the identification of positive outliers, process tracing and comparative analysis of five World Bank projects from the 1990s that were also the focus of subsequent academic research. Tangible openings from above that enabled countervailing power took two main forms: 1) institutionalized power-sharing over allocation of social funds - at local, subnational and national levels and 2) support for autonomous, multi-level social organizations, including collective titling of ethnic territories. Over the longer term, projects lacked strong national allies and their most innovative contributions were reversed, watered down or at best contained - though these differences mattered to social actors on the ground. The most analytically significant finding is that projects can have not only contested and uneven outcomes (mixed results), but also contradictory interaction effects.

The findings of epidemiological and entomological investigations conducted after this outbreak are presented here. Methods: Data related to malaria cases reported to the French armed forces epidemiological surveillance system were collected during the epidemic period from December 2010 to April 2011. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify presumed contamination sites. Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled at the identified sites using Mosquito Magnet and CDC light traps. Specimens were identified morphologically and confirmed using molecular methods (sequencing of ITS2 gene and/or barcoding). Anopheles infections with Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were tested by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time PCR. Results: Seventy-two P. vivax malaria cases were reported (three were mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax infections), leading to a global attack rate of 26.5 % (72/272). Lack of compliance with vector control measures and doxycycline chemoprophylaxis was reported by patients. Two illegal gold mining sites located in remote areas in the primary forest were identified as places of contamination. In all, 595 Anopheles females were caught and 528 specimens were formally identified: 305 Anopheles darlingi, 145 Anopheles nuneztovari s. l., 63 Anopheles marajoara and 15 Anopheles triannulatus s. l. Three An. darlingi were infected by P. falciparum (infection rate: 1.1 %) and four An. marajoara by P. vivax (infection rate: 6.4 %). Discussion: The main drivers of the outbreak were the lack of adherence by military personnel to malaria prevention measures and the high level of malaria transmission at illegal gold mining sites. Anopheles marajoara was clearly implicated in malaria transmission for the first time in French Guiana. The high infection rates observed confirm that illegal gold mining sites must be considered as high level malaria transmission areas in the territory. Conclusions: Illegal gold mining activities are challenging the control of malaria in French Guiana. Collaboration with neighbouring countries is necessary to take into account mobile populations such as gold miners. Malaria control strategies in the French armed forces must be adapted to P. vivax malaria and sylvatic Anopheles species.","[de Santi, Vincent Pommier; Dia, Aissata; Deparis, Xavier] French Armed Forces Ctr Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CES, Camp Mil St Marthe,BP 40026, F-13568 Marseille 02, France; [de Santi, Vincent Pommier; Briolant, Sebastien] Quartier La Madeleine, Direct Interarmees Serv Sante Guyane, BP 6019, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana; [Girod, Romain; Dusfour, Isabelle] Inst Pasteur, Med Entomol Unit, 23 Ave Pasteur,BP 6010, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana; [Mura, Marie; Briolant, Sebastien] Inst Rech Biomed Armees, BP 73, F-91223 Bretigny Sur Orge, France; [Briolant, Sebastien] Inst Pasteur, Parasitol Lab, 23 Ave Pasteur,BP 6010, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana; [Djossou, Felix] Andree Rosemon Hosp, Unit Infect & Trop Dis, Ave Flamboyants, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Mendibil, Alexandre] Antenne Med Castres, Quartier Fayolle 68 Ave J Desplat,CS 50025, F-81108 Castres, France; [Simon, Fabrice] Laveran Mil Teaching Hosp, Dept Infect Dis & Trop Med, 34 Blvd Laveran,BP 50, F-13013 Marseille, France; [Pages, Frederic] Inst Veille Sanitaire, Cire Ocean Indien, 2 Bis,Ave Georges Brassens,CS 61002, St Denis 97743, Reunion, France",,"de Santi, VP (corresponding author), French Armed Forces Ctr Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CES, Camp Mil St Marthe,BP 40026, F-13568 Marseille 02, France.",v.pommierdesanti@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,24,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 22,2016.0,15.0,,,,,,,35,10.1186/s12936-016-1088-x,,,,,,,,WOS:000368594500003,

A study with an indigenous community in eastern Panama revealed a considerable biophysical potential for carbon offsets in small-scale slash-and-burn agriculture through longer fallow periods, improved fallow management, secondary forest development, and agricultural intensification. Based on soil and biomass carbon measurements, estimated annual sequestration rates amount to 0.3-3.7 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Despite such potential, the economic benefits of initiatives aimed at sequestration of carbon in the community are likely to be rather unequally distributed within the community. Heterogeneity in livelihood strategies and uneven asset endowments among households factors often overlooked in the ongoing carbon and sustainable development debate - are expected to strongly affect household participation. Indeed, only the better-endowed households that have also managed to diversify into more lucrative farm and non-farm activities are likely to be able to participate in and thus benefit from improved crop-fallow systems that capture carbon.

We recently reported the lack of serious neurological symptoms in a Japanese fish-eating population with high intakes of MeHg and suggested a potential protective role for Se. Here, relationships between levels of Hg and Se in the blood and plasma samples, with a quantitative evaluation of Se-containing proteins, obtained from this population were examined. While levels of the whole-blood Hg (WB-Hg) and plasma Se (P-Se) showed a positive correlation, stratified analysis revealed that they correlated only in samples with higher (greater than the median) levels of MeHg. A food frequency questionnaire showed that consumption of fish/whales correlated with WB-Hg, but not with P-Se, suggesting that the positive correlation between WB-Hg and P-Se might not be the result of cointake of these elements from seafood. Speciation of plasma Se revealed the differences in the responses of two plasma selenoproteins, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and selenoprotein P (SePP), in relation to Hg exposure. In the high-Hg group, SePP showed a positive correlation with WB-Hg, but GPx did not. In the low-Hg group, neither SePP nor GPx showed any correlation with WB-Hg.

However, polymorphisms of DBPII are the major obstacle to designing a successful vaccine. Here, we examined whether anti-DBPII antibodies from individual P. vivax exposures provide strain-transcending immunity and whether their presence is associated with DBPII haplotypes found in patients with acute P. vivax. The ability of antibodies to inhibit DBL-TH-erythrocyte binding was tested by COS7 erythrocyte binding inhibition assay. Seven samples of high responders (HR) were identified from screening anti-DBPII levels. HR no. 3 and HR no. 6 highly inhibited all DBL-TH binding to erythrocytes, by >80%. Antibodies from these two patients' plasma had the potential to be broadly inhibitory against DBL-TH1, -TH2, -TH6, -TH7, -TH8 and -TH9 haplotypes when plasma was serially diluted from 1: 500 to 1: 2000. To further examine the association of DBPII haplotypes and the ability of antibodies to broadly inhibit DBL-TH variants, the individual samples underwent sequencing analysis and the inhibitory function of the anti-DBPII antibodies was tested. The patterns of DBPII polymorphisms in acute patients were classified into two groups, DBPII Sal I (55%) and DBL-TH variants (45%). Plasma from Sal I and DBPII-TH patients who had the highest inhibition against Sal I or DBL-TH4 and -TH5 was serially diluted from 1: 500 to 1: 2000 and their inhibitory capacity was tested against a panel of DBL-TH haplotypes. Results provided evidence of both strain-transcending inhibition as well as strain-specific inhibition by antibodies that blocked erythrocyte binding against some DBL-TH variants and against homologous alleles. This study demonstrated broad inhibition by anti-DBPII antibodies against DBL-TH haplotypes in natural P. vivax exposed individuals. The identification of conserved epitopes among DBL-TH may have implications for vaccine development of a DBPII-based vaccine against diverse P. vivax infections.","[Wongkidakarn, Sudarat; Chootong, Patchanee] Mahidol Univ, Dept Clin Microbiol & Appl Technol, Fac Med Technol, Bangkok 10700, Thailand; [McHenry, Amy M.] Southwestern Adventist Univ, Dept Biol, Keene, TX USA; [Sattabongkot, Jetsumon] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Mahidol Vivax Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand; [Adams, John H.] Univ S Florida, Dept Global Hlth, Tampa, FL USA",,"Chootong, P (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Dept Clin Microbiol & Appl Technol, Fac Med Technol, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.",pchooton@gmail.com,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 4,2016.0,11.0,5,,,,,,e0154577,10.1371/journal.pone.0154577,,,,,,,,WOS:000375676400054,

In recent decades, woody plant continues to expand and form forest (above 2 m in height) across the SGP. However, our knowledge of the forest amount and distribution in this region is very limited. This study aims to map forest, especially evergreen forest (above 2 m in height) in the SGP for the time period of 2015-2017. Annual mosaic data of HH and HV polarization backscattering (25 m) from Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) aboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2), along with their difference (HH-HV) and ratio (HH/HV) were utilized. With the four bands (HH, HV, difference, ratio) of 2017, decision rules of forest were developed based on 30 randomly selected forest plots (as of 2017) across the study area. With the decision rules, a PALSAR-2 based forest map was created for each year from 2015 to 2017. Then an annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold of 0.5, derived from Landsat 8 data of 2017 and the 30 forest plots, was used to filter potential commission error of rough surface and building in each PALSAR-2 based forest map. After that, a forest map circa 2016 was generated, in which each forest pixel was identified as such at least twice during 2015 and 2017. Lastly, a threshold of seasonal NDVI change (0.3) was derived to extract evergreen forest out of the forest map circa 2016. Accuracy assessment for the result forest map suggests a user's accuracy of 99.2% and a producer's accuracy of 88.7% for forest. Accuracy assessment for the evergreen forest map suggests a user's accuracy of 97.3% and a producer's accuracy of 90.5% for evergreen forest.

Currently, there is no agreement on the rate of relaxation and the factors that it depends on. Here we find that half-life increases with area for all groups examined in a large meta-analysis of extinction data.

A multiscale, global-to-local-to-global (GLG) framework is thus needed for comprehensive analyses of LUCC and leakage. The number of GLG-LUCC studies has grown substantially over the past years, but no reviews of this literature and their contributions have been completed so far. In fact, the largest body of literature pertains to global-to-local impacts exclusively, whereas research on local feedback to regional, national, and global spheres remain scarce, and are almost solely undertaken within large modeling institutes. As such, those are rarely readily accessible for modification and extension by outside contributors. This review of the recent GLG-LUCC studies calls for more open-source modeling and availability of data, arguing that the latter is the real constraint to more widespread analyses of GLG-LUCC impacts.

We derive general results that reveal how dynamic models that simulate growth as an increase in a linear measure of size (e.g., diameter, length, height) result in biased estimates of future mean biomass when uncertainty in growth is misrepresented. Our case study shows how models of tree growth that predict the same mean diameter increment, but with alternative representations of growth uncertainty, result in almost a threefold difference in the projections of future mean tree biomass after a 20-yr simulation. These results have important implications concerning our ability to accurately predict future biomass and all the related environmental services (e.g., forest carbon content, timber and fishery yields). If the objective is to predict future biomass, we strongly recommend that: (1) ecological modelers should choose a growth model based on a variable more linearly related to biomass (e.g., tree basal area instead of tree diameter for forest models); (2) if field measurements preclude the use of variables other than the linear measure of size, both the mean and other statistical moments (e.g., covariances) should be carefully modeled; (3) careful assessment be done on models that aggregate similar individuals (i.e., cohort models) to see if neglecting autocorrelated growth from individuals leads to biased estimates of future mean biomass.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Levine Sci Res Ctr, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Valle, D (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Levine Sci Res Ctr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",drvalle1@gmail.com,,,,,,,2,4,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2011.0,21.0,4,,,,1031,1036,,10.1890/10-0830.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000291535500004,

We assessed the effects of reduced impact logging (RIL, with a 30-year rotation management plan) and conventional logging (CL, without a management plan) on physical and biochemical characteristics of Ferralsol soils that developed on pre-Cambrian rocks in rainforests of Cameroon. Five to seven months after the logging operations were completed, we mapped the CL and RIL sites and quantified the disturbed areas: felling gaps, skidding trails, logging decks and roads. We selected four replicate plots at each site that encompassed these four disturbed strata and an adjacent undisturbed area as the reference. At each disturbed stratum and reference area per plot, we took soil samples down to 50 cm, and quantified soil physical and biochemical characteristics. Nutrient exports with timber harvest were also quantified. The logging intensity was very low with removals of 0.2 and 0.3 tree per hectare, and the ground area disturbed accounted only 5.2% and 4.0% of the total area in CL and RIL, respectively. In terms of area disturbance for each harvested tree, CL had 753 m(2) tree(-1) more affected ground area than RIL. Roads and logging decks were the most affected by logging operations, where effective cation exchange capacity, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), Bray-extractable phosphorus (P) and exchangeable aluminum decreased whereas pH, N-15 natural abundance and exchangeable manganese increased compared to the undisturbed reference area (P < 0.01-0.04). The disturbed area showed overall reductions of 21-29% in SOC, N and P stocks relative to the reference areas (P = 0.02-0.07). The amounts of C, N, P and base cations exported with harvested timber were only 0.4-5.9% of the changes in stocks of these elements in the disturbed strata. Nutrient reductions in the soil and exports through timber harvest were comparable between CL and RIL, after one logging event in this very low intensity logging systems. Our results suggest that unplanned operations together with frequent re logging inherent to CL can increase area damage and enhance changes in SOC and nutrients as opposed to RIL, which may affect the recovery of the succeeding vegetation.","[Lontsi, Rodine Tchiofo; Cone, Marife D.; van Straaten, Oliver; Veldkamp, Edzo] Univ Goettingen, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, Soil Sci Trop & Subtrop Ecosyst, Buesgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",,"Lontsi, RT (corresponding author), Univ Goettingen, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, Soil Sci Trop & Subtrop Ecosyst, Buesgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",rtchiof@gwdg.de; mcorre@gwdg.de; ostraat@gwdg.de; eveldka@gwdg.de,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 1,2019.0,451.0,,,,,,,117522,10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117522,,,,,,,,WOS:000487577400003,

Distribution of T-Hg in sediments and the macrophyte Eichhornia crassipes showed that higher concentrations were found along the flooding pathway of the Cauca River. Hg has also polluted the food chain. Highest T-Hg concentrations in fish were detected for the carnivorous Pseudoplatystoma fasciatun (0.432 +/- 0.107g/g, fresh weight [fw]), and lowest in the non-carnivorous Prochilodus magdalenae (0.143 +/- 0.053g/g, fw), with differences between trophic levels.

Efficient programs to conserve native biodiversity require a sound understanding of the relation between forest cover and the spatial pattern of forest fragments, but these issues remain almost unknown for subtropical ecosystems. We examine the forest fragmentation of the Gran Chaco in central Argentina over the last 30 years. In particular, we quantify forest loss and spatial pattern changes using random sampling techniques on multi-temporal forest cover maps (1979, 1999 and 2010). We analyzed forest fragmentation according to the following steps: (i) selection of fragmentation pattern indices (Pis), (ii) sampling on forest cover maps and PIs calculation, (iii) statistical comparison by bootstrapping, and (iv) trajectory analysis. During the last three decades, forest cover declined dramatically (similar to 90%) and the selected pattern metrics (MPS, PD, ED) varied significantly (p < 0.05). The results depict a devastating situation of Gran Chaco forests with a progressive reduction to few small fragments during the last decades. Furthermore when forest loss exceeded the similar to 50% of the total land area, the temporal trajectories of the selected PIs underwent an abrupt change. Distinguishing habitat spatial pattern changes from forest loss over time supports the identification of specific conservation actions and provide the basis to establish the lower threshold of forest cover and the more effective arrangement of fragments necessary to mitigate the fragmentation effects.

Conservation issues are complex and solutions require a clear understanding on how socioeconomic factors act as driving forces for stream degradation and how stream ecosystems respond to those forces. This chapter reviews the major factors impacting tropical streams: over-exploiting (mainly over-fishing), deforestation, water abstraction for irrigation and human consumption, pollution, and alterations in riverine connectivity. Major issues are also summarized for tropical regions (e.g. Latin America and the Caribbean, tropical Africa).

RSC emissions can be produced for up to several weeks after the passage of a flame front and they are mostly unaffected by flames. Fuels prone to RSC include downed logs, duff, and organic soils. Limited observations in the tropics and the boreal forest suggest that RSC is a globally significant source of emissions to the troposphere. This source was previously uncharacterized. We measured the first emission factors (EF) for RSC in a series of laboratory fires and in a wooded savanna in Zambia, Africa. We report EFRSC for both particles with diameter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and the major trace gases as measured by open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy. The major trace gases include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethene, acetylene, propene, formaldehyde, methanol, acetic acid, formic acid, glycolaldehyde, phenol, furan, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide. We show that a model used to predict trace gas EF for fires in a wide variety of aboveground fine fuels fails to predict EF for RSC. For many compounds, our EF for RSC-prone fuels from the boreal forest and wooded savanna are very different from the EF for the same compounds measured in fire convection columns above these ecosystems. We couple our newly measured EFRSC with estimates of fuel consumption by RSC to refine emission estimates for fires in the boreal forest and wooded savanna. We find some large changes in estimates of biomass fire emissions with the inclusion of RSC. For instance, the wooded savanna methane EF increases by a factor of 2.5 even when RSC accounts for only 10% of fuel consumption. This shows that many more measurements of fuel consumption and EF for RSC are needed to improve estimates of biomass burning emissions.","Univ Montana, Dept Chem, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; US Forest Serv, Fire Sci Lab, USDA, Missoula, MT USA",,"Bertschi, I (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Bothell, WA USA.",byok@selway.umt.edu,,,,,,,125,126,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 15,2003.0,108.0,D13,,,,,,8472,10.1029/2002JD002100,,,,,,,,WOS:000181938000001,

The quality of the estimates ranges from reasonable to poor across the countries. This paper aims to give a first order estimate of the amount and location of mercury being released into the environment globally by ASGM, to motivate stakeholders to improve the quality of these estimates, to illustrate the linkages between Global mercury trade and its use in ASGM, and the fourth objective is to provide a practical Outline of the options available for reducing mercury use in ASGM. We estimate that artisanal and small scale gold mining releases between 640 to 1350 Mg of mercury per annum into the environment, averaging 1000 Mg yr(-1), from at least 70 countries. 350 Mg yr(-1) of this are directly emitted to the atmosphere while the remainder (650 Mg yr(-1)) are released into the hydrosphere (rivers, lakes, soils, tailings). However, a significant but unknown portion of the amount released into the hydrosphere is later emitted to the atmosphere when it volatilizes (latent emissions). Considering that ASGM is growing, latent emissions conservatively amount to at least 50 Mg yr-1 bringing the total emission of mercury to the atmosphere from ASGM to 400 Mg yr(-1). This estimate of emission to the atmosphere differs from the previous one provided in the 2002 UNEP Global Mercury Assessment both in terms of its magnitude (400 Mg yr(-1), versus 300 Mg yr(-1)) and in the way the estimate has been made. The current estimate is based on a better understanding of ASGM and oil a wider variety of information Sources, more field evidence, better extrapolation methods, and independent testing by analysis of official trade data.","[Telmer, Kevin M.] Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Veiga, Marcello M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Min Engn, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",,"Telmer, KM (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",,,,,,,,175,179,,,,,,,,,,,,2009.0,,,,,,131,172,,10.1007/978-0-387-93958-2_6,10.1007/978-0-387-93958-2,,,,,,,WOS:000270022200006,

Systematic conservation planning (SCP) is a field of study designed to improve conservation programs by identifying land configurations that, if protected, would most efficiently sustain biodiversity. Despite contributing to species persistence in landscapes, SCP has been criticized for replacing site-based conservation plans that often consider social context. In contrast, land system science (LSS), an emerging field that explores the process of land-use and land-cover change, integrates social systems and processes into conservation analyses. We suggest that by incorporating insights from LSS on social processes (eg livelihood adaptation or agricultural intensification), SCP can enhance the legitimacy of conservation plans, thereby reducing the gap between conservation planning and implementation. This represents a necessary first step for SCP to reinvent itself as a decision-support tool that helps to reconcile the long-standing divide between landscape-level species conservation and social needs.","[Iwamura, Takuya] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [de Waroux, Yann le Polain] McGill Univ, Inst Study Int Dev, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [de Waroux, Yann le Polain] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mascia, Michael B.] Moore Ctr Sci, Conservat Int, Arlington, VA USA",,"Iwamura, T (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.",takuya@tauex.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2018.0,16.0,7,,,,388,396,,10.1002/fee.1824,,,,,,,,WOS:000443127200007,

We suggest that the quality of governance affects both aspects of effectiveness but recognize a lack of synthetic understanding of the topic. We present a conceptual framework linking the underlying mechanisms by which the quality of governance affects conservation outcomes in PAs and how this relates to conservation planning. We show that it is crucial to separate pressure and response and how these together will lead to the observed conservation outcomes. We urge for more focused attention on governance factors and in particular more empirical research on how to address causality and how to account for the quality of governance when prioritizing actions.

Furthermore, Hg contents in river water are two orders higher than the EPA guideline for aquatic life and the concentration in drinking water exceeds the WHO recommended value. The seasonal Hg variation in the Cuyuni river samples shows high loading rates during the raining period, which can be associated with high particulate and TOC contents caused by high run-off rate. Mercury concentration in edible fish tissue depends on the feeding habit, e.g. carnivorous species show higher Hg concentration (range 0.32-1.92 mg/kg) than herbivorous species (range 0.12-0.46 mg/kg).

A critical issue is whether the global production of BC results in significant amounts of carbon (C) being removed from the short-term bio-atmospheric carbon cycle and transferred to the long-term geological carbon cycle. Several dozen field and laboratory based studies of BC formation during the burning of biomass have been documented. Findings are difficult to interpret because they have been expressed in an inconsistent manner, and because different physical and chemical methods have been used to derive them. High error terms documented in many of these studies also highlight the problems associated with the quantification of the amount of biomass C consumed in fire, the amount of residue produced and the constituents of that residue. To be able to estimate the potential for BC as a carbon sink, issues regarding its definition, the methods used in its identification and measurement, and the way it is expressed in relation to other components of the carbon cycle need to be addressed. This paper presents BC data in a standard way; BC production as a percentage of the amount of C consumed by fire (BC/CC), which can be readily integrated into a larger carbon budget. Results from previous studies and new data from Australian ecosystems were recalculated in this way. As part of this process, several BC estimates derived solely from physical methods were discarded, based on their inability to accurately identify and quantify the BC component of the post-fire residue. Instead, more focus was placed on BC estimates obtained by chemical methods. This recalculated data lowered the estimate for BC formation in forest fires from 4% to 5% to < 3% BUCC. For savannah and grassland fires a value of < 3% is consistent with reported data, but considerable variation among estimates remains. An updated flow-chart linking the sources, fluxes and pools of BC formed in the terrestrial environment with the aquatic and marine environments, and estimates of mean residence times for BC are also presented.

Along the China-Myanmar border, an additional problem arose as a result of the settlement of internally displaced people (IDP) in the border region. Since asymptomatic malaria significantly impacts transmission dynamics, assessment of the prevalence, dynamics and risk factors of asymptomatic malaria infections is necessary. Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were carried out in 3 seasons (March and April, July and November) and 2 sites (villages and IDP camps) in 2015. A total of 1680 finger-prick blood samples were collected and used for parasite detection by microscopy and nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR). Logistic regression models were used to explore the risk factors associated with asymptomatic malaria at individual and household levels. Results: The prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections was 23.3% by nRT-PCR, significantly higher than that detected by microscopy (1.5%). The proportions of Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and mixed-species infections were 89.6,8.1 and 2.3%, respectively. Asymptomatic infections showed obvious seasonality with higher prevalence in the rainy season. Logistic regression analysis identified males and school children (<= 15 years) as the high-risk populations. Vector-based interventions, including bed net and indoor residual spray, were found to have significant impacts on asymptomatic Plasmodium infections, with non-users of these measures carrying much higher risks of infection. In addition, individuals living in poorly constructed households or farther away from clinics were more prone to asymptomatic infections. Conclusions: Sub-microscopic Plasmodium infections were highly prevalent in the border human populations from IDP camps and surrounding villages. Both individual- and household-level risk factors were identified, which provides useful information for identifying the high-priority populations to implement targeted malaria control.","[Zhao, Yan; Zeng, Jie; Zhao, Yonghong; Liu, Qingyang; He, Yang; Wang, Qinghui; Cui, Liwang; Cao, Yaming] China Med Univ, Coll Basic Med Sci, Dept Immunol, Shenyang 110122, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiaqi; Yang, Zhaoqing] Kunming Med Univ, Dept Pathogen Biol & Immunol, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Fan, Qi] Dalian Inst Biotechnol, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Cui, Liwang] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, State Coll, PA 16802 USA",,"Wang, QH; Cui, LW; Cao, YM (corresponding author), China Med Univ, Coll Basic Med Sci, Dept Immunol, Shenyang 110122, Liaoning, Peoples R China.; Cui, LW (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, State Coll, PA 16802 USA.",gaihui2010@163.com; luc2@psu.edu; ymcao@cmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,22,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 4,2018.0,17.0,,,,,,,247,10.1186/s12936-018-2398-y,,,,,,,,WOS:000437425600002,

This study helps to fill this gap in the literature by investigating the drivers of forest-to-agriculture conversion in one of the largest metropolitan areas and its surrounding peri-urban regions in Canada, focusing on the effect of farmland losses to development. A unique contribution of this study is that we take into account the heterogeneous forestland availability in the empirical investigation, which makes the estimation more realistic and accurate. Generalized spatial two-stage least square (GS2SLS) models are adopted to control for spillover effects from deforestation activities in neighboring areas and also to solve the potential endogeneity problem resulted from simultaneous land-use changes. Key findings include the following: agricultural land losses are an important driver for deforestation, and the magnitude of impact increases as the availability of forest-cover increases; population growth hinders the process of deforestation; high road density encourages forestland conversion to agriculture. Future policy-design shall find it helpful to incorporate the agricultural land expansion onto forestland due to land development when evaluating the social, economic, and environmental consequences of urbanization.

These deforestation rates explain little about the relative performance of the different land use categories under equivalent conversion risks due to the confounding effects of location. An estimated 25% of lands allocated for timber harvesting in 2000 had their status changed to industrial plantation concessions in 2010. Based on a sample of 3,391 forest plots (161 km; 100 ha), and matching statistical analyses, 2000-2010 deforestation was on average 17.6 ha lower (95% C.

When location effects were accounted for, deforestation rates in timber concessions and protected areas were not significantly different (Mean difference: 0.35 ha; 95% C. I.: -0.002 ha-0.7 ha). Natural forest timber concessions in Kalimantan had similar ability as protected areas to maintain forest cover during 2000-2010, provided the former were not reclassified to industrial plantation concessions.

A regression tree-based model (Random Forest) produces good results (cross-validated R-2 0.81, RMSE 13 T/ha) when trained with a sufficient number of field plots representative of the vegetation variability at national scale. The Random Forest model captures non-linear relationships between satellite data and biomass density, and is able to use categorical data (land cover) in the regression to improve the results. Biomass estimates were strongly correlated (r = 0.90 and r = 0.83) with independent LiDAR measurements. In this study, we demonstrate that in certain contexts Landsat data provide the capability to spatialize field biomass measurements and produce accurate and detailed estimates of biomass distribution at national scale. We also investigate limitations of this approach, which tend to provide conservative biomass estimates. Specific limitations are mainly related to saturation of the optical signal at high biomass density and cloud cover, which hinders the compilation of a radiometrically consistent multi-temporal dataset As a result, a Landsat mosaic created for Uganda with images acquired in the dry season during 1999-2003 does not contain phenological information useful for discriminating some vegetation types, such as deciduous formations. The addition of land cover data increases the model performance because it provides information on vegetation phenology. We note that Landsat data present higher spatial and thematic resolution compared to land cover and allow detailed and spatially continuous biomass estimates to be mapped. Fusion of satellite and ancillary data may improve biomass predictions but, to avoid error propagation, accurate, detailed and up-to-date land cover or other ancillary data are necessary.

This proposal is illustrated with application examples for advanced growth modelling in tropical forests, a short overview on financial performance analyses for tropical land uses, and the introduction of a new modelling approach. This modelling approach sees tropical land management as a financial portfolio of land-use options. Its advantage is the ability to make transparent effects of financial risk reduction that arise from mixing forestry and agriculture-based land-use options. The approach thus does not analyse land uses as stand-alone options, like most other analyses do. The land-use portfolio modelling shows that sustainable land use may also be financially attractive for farmers, if abandoned farm lands are reforested (with a native tree species in our case) and sustainable management in natural forests is carried out. We conclude that the combination of advanced growth with sound financial modelling may lead to improved bioeconomic models.

The proposed logic is reconfigurable, and can calculate all the conditions (mentioned above) for one 64-bit, two 32-bit, four 16-bit, or eight 8-bit signed and unsigned operands. The reconfigurability of the logic is achieved using only four control signals.

The proposed logic is designed for VLIW or Media processors, which require a high degree of reconfigurability, and high speed operation. It can also be used in MIPS family of processors for early branch condition resolution, to avoid branch stalls.

Such a model must be conservative, since it is acceptable to fix a problem that may or may not exist, but not acceptable to fabricate a chip that does not work. This paper examines the tradeoffs between different crosstalk models, with experimental data on the effectiveness and computer demands of different types of analysis and fixing. A lumped crosstalk model with timing windows and slopes, and with characterized cell thresholds, reaches the point of diminishing returns in the examples shown. All errors reported by such a model can be repaired without increasing the chip size or hurting the performance, so a more detailed analysis is unnecessary.","Cadence Design Syst, San Jose, CA 95008 USA",,"Scheffer, L (corresponding author), Cadence Design Syst, 555 River Oaks Pkwy, San Jose, CA 95008 USA.",lou@cadence.com,,,,,,,4,6,,,,,,,,,,,,2000.0,,,,,,315,320,,10.1109/SBCCI.2000.876048,,,,,,,,WOS:000090089700049,

There are difficult manufacturing limitations when scaling threshold voltages (mainly due to intra- and inter-chip variations) but the general view seems to be that continuous voltage scaling would be beneficial if manufacturing allowed it. While these qualitative results are well-known, we present for the first time a quantitative analysis of voltage scaling limits from the low power perspective. Our main new result is that optimizing the supply and threshold voltages for minimum energy-delay product [3], [8] is independent of the process or technology (up to a first order analysis). With this theoretical analysis followed by extensive simulations, we show that, for a given circuit, the optimal supply and threshold voltages are approximately the same in all CMOS technologies available through MOSIS (2 mum to 0.35 mum). This result is nonintuitive, represents a clear limit to voltage scaling from the low power point of view, and is contrary to the common view of a continuously scaling scenario if technology permits. The limit is not absolute, though, since it can be overcome by circuit design techniques (e.g. reducing logic depth), or other techniques (e.g. cooling).","Intel Corp, Dupont, WA USA",,"Forestier, A (corresponding author), Intel Corp, Dupont, WA USA.",,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,2000.0,,,,,,365,370,,10.1109/SBCCI.2000.876056,,,,,,,,WOS:000090089700057,

At the station level, three variables are considered: the total precipitation amount (P), the number of rain days (NRD) and the daily rainfall intensity (INT). Using a network of 34 stations, inter-station correlations (1958-1987) are computed for each of these variables. The spatial coherence of monthly or seasonal P and NRD is always much higher than that of rainfall intensity. However, large variations in spatial coherence are found in the course of the seasonal cycle. Coherence is highest at the peak of the short rains (October-December) and low during the long rains (March-May), except at its beginning. The inter-annual variability of the onset and cessation of the rains is next considered, at the regional scale, and the study extended to 2001. In the long rains, the onset and cessation dates are independent of NRD and INT during the rainy season. Hence, the long rains seasonal rainfall total depends on a combination of virtually unrelated factors, which may account for the difficulty in its prediction. However, the onset, which exhibits a large inter-annual variability and a strong spatial coherence, has a prime role. Conversely, in the short rains, though the onset is again more decisive than the cessation, the different intra-seasonal descriptors of the rains are more strongly inter-related.","[Camberlin, Pierre; Philippon, Nathalie; Gitau, Wilson] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, CRC, Dijon, France; [Moron, Vincent] Univ Aix Marseille 1, CEREGE, Aix En Provence, France; [Moron, Vincent] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Palisades, NY USA; [Moron, Vincent] Inst Univ France IUP, Paris, France; [Okoola, Raphael; Gitau, Wilson] Univ Nairobi, Dept Meteorol, Nairobi, Kenya; [Gitau, Wilson] IGAD Climate Predict & Applicat Ctr ICPAC, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Camberlin, P (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, CRC, Dijon, France.",camber@u-bourgogne.fr,,,,,,,75,76,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2009.0,98.0,3-4,,,,237,249,,10.1007/s00704-009-0113-1,,,,,,,,WOS:000269439300003,

This study characterized the Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface antigen 180 (PvMSA180, PVX_094920), a novel P. vivax antigenic protein. Methods: The target gene was amplified as four overlapping domains (D1, D2, D3 and D4) to enable expression of the recombinant protein using cell-free and bacterial expression systems. The recombinant PvMSA180 proteins were used in protein microarrays to evaluate the humoral immune response of 72 vivax-infected patients and 24 vivax-naive individuals. Antibodies produced in mice against the PvMSA180-D1 and -D4 domains were used to assess the subcellular localization of schizont-stage parasites with immunofluorescence assays. A total of 51 pvmsa180 sequences from 12 countries (41 sequences from PlasmoDB and 6 generated in this study) were used to determine the genetic diversity and genealogical relationships with DNAsp and NETWORK software packages, respectively. Results: PvMSA180 consists of 1603 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 182 kDa, and has a signal peptide at the amino-terminus. A total of 70.8% of patients (51/72) showed a specific antibody response to at least one of the PvMSA180 domains, and 20.8% (15/72) exhibited a robust antibody response to at least three of the domains. These findings suggest that PvMSA180 is targeted by the humoral immune response during natural infection with P. vivax. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that PvMSA180 is localized on the merozoite surface of schizontstage parasites, and pvmsa180 sequences originating from various geographic regions worldwide showed low genetic diversity. Twenty-two haplotypes were found, and haplotype 6 (Hap_6, 77%) of pvmsa180 was detected in isolates from six countries. Conclusions: A novel P. vivax surface protein, PvMSA180, was characterized in this study. Most of P. vivax-infected patients had specific antibodies against particular antigenic domains, indicating that this protein is immunogenic in naturally exposed populations. Genetic analysis of worldwide isolates showed that pvmsa180 is less polymorphic than other well-known candidates and that some haplotypes are common to several countries. However, additional studies with a larger sample size are necessary to evaluate the antibody responses in geographically separated populations, and to identify the function of PvMSA180 during parasite invasion.","[Muh, Fauzi; Han, Jin-Hee; Nyunt, Myat Htut; Lee, Seong-Kyun; Ahmed, Md Atique; Han, Eun-Taek] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Med Environm Biol & Trop Med, Sch Med, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Nyunt, Myat Htut] Dept Med Res, Yangon, Myanmar; [Jeon, Hye-Yoon; Ha, Kwon-Soo] Kangwon Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Biol, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Park, Won Sun] Kangwon Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Hong, Seok-Ho] Kangwon Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Na, Sunghun] Kangwon Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Takashima, Eizo; Tsuboi, Takafumi] Ehime Univ, Div Malaria Res, Proteosci Ctr, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan",,"Han, ET (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Med Environm Biol & Trop Med, Sch Med, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",ethan@kangwon.ac.kr,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 28,2017.0,16.0,,,,,,,133,10.1186/s12936-017-1760-9,,,,,,,,WOS:000397736700001,

Urban sprawl, characterized by scattered and low-density urban development, is commonly criticized for its negative ecological impact. In response, growth management policies have been proposed in order to promote compact development, which is generally considered more favorable from an ecological perspective. Spatial simulations of land cover change are useful for comparing urban development scenarios and their potential effects. One aspect that has not received much attention is how the rate of development may affect differences between compact development and urban sprawl in terms of their potential impact to biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale. Our goal in this study was to compare the spatial pattern and landscape-scale conservation and ecological implications of sprawling development (expected under unregulated development) versus compact development (promoted by growth management policies) at different development rates. We focused on Israel's Mediterranean region-a region characterized by high human population density and heterogeneous land cover. Using a cellular automata model, DINAMICA-EGO, we calibrated and validated an urban development model for the period between 1998 and 2007. Using this period as a reference, we simulated two scenarios 20 years into the future: unregulated (resulting in a more sprawling development pattern) versus regulated development (resulting in a more compact development pattern). For each scenario we analyzed a range of development rates, and compared built-up area patterns, and several landscape-level attributes of natural habitats, conservation priority areas, and protected areas. We found that at development rates comparable to those observed during 1998-2007, there was no major difference between the two scenarios. At higher development rates, some differences between the scenarios emerged: natural core areas were more fragmented and smaller in their extent, and a higher proportion of conservation priority areas were expected to undergo development in the unregulated scenario. Overall, the regulated scenario was more favorable for conservation. Since the regulated and unregulated scenarios exhibited only minor differences in lower development rates, modifications to policy measures included in the regulated scenario should be considered in order improve its effectiveness.

Water, sediments, plankton, fish, and human samples from Grande Marsh, a Hg-polluted marsh located in the south of Bolivar, municipality of Montecristo, Colombia, were collected during both the rainy and the dry seasons (2003-2006), at three different sampling sites, and analyzed for total Hg (T-Hg) content. Water, sediment, seston, phytoplankton, and zooplankton T-Hg concentrations were 0.33 +/- 0.03 mu g/L, 0.71 +/- 0.03, 1.20 +/- 0.06, 0.52 +/- 0.03, and 0.94 +/- 0.05 mu g/g dry weight (wt), respectively. T-Hg levels in these compartments were highly pair-correlated (p < 0.05), and for all of them, except sediments, greater values were found during the dry season. Significant differences were observed for T-Hg concentrations in fish according to their trophic position. Average highest T-Hg values were found in carnivorous species such as Caquetaia kraussi (1.09 +/- 0.17 mu g/g fresh wt), Hoplias malabaricus (0.58 +/- 0.05 mu g/g fresh wt), and Plagioscion surinamensis (0.53 +/- 0.07 mu g/g fresh wt), whereas the lowest were detected in noncarnivorous species such as Prochilodus magdalenae (0.157 +/- 0.01 mu g/g fresh wt). In those fish species where seasonal comparisons were possible, specimens captured during the dry season had greater T-Hg levels in muscle. Although the T-Hg mean level for all fish samples (0.407 +/- 0.360 mu g/g fresh wt) did not exceed the recommended limit ingestion level, risk assessment based on the hazard index suggested that a fish intake of 0.12 kg per day (a small carnivorous specimen) could increase the potential health effects related to Hg exposure in the local human population, whose hair T-Hg median value was 4.7 mu g/g, and presented a low but significant correlation with fish consumption (r = 0.250, p = 0.016).

Inorganic N stocks and N cycling rates were highest in the forest and lower in the coffee gardens.

Emissions on recently cleared land were 4.6 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) and 8.4 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) in a 1-year-old coffee garden. Emissions in the older coffee gardens were lower with the lowest flux observed in a 10 year old site (1.8 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1)).

Emissions in an 18-year-old multistrata coffee garden with a significant overstory of N fixing trees were 5 times greater (15.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) than emissions from forests. We also found that intensive organic matter management produced high emissions. To understand the spatial and temporal variability of the N(2)O emissions we used the hole-in-the-pipe conceptual model. N(2)O fluxes were lowest on N limited sites. Soil water content also played an important role and emissions were highest when water filled pore space (WFPS) was between 85 and 95%. A number of formulations of this model have been applied in different ways over the years to explain spatial and temporal variation in the soil N-oxide flux, and in this study we found the mechanistic explanation useful. Our study suggests that land use change and intensification of agriculture in N limited highland landscapes may significantly increase the biosphere to atmosphere flux of N gases.","Int Ctr Res Agroforestry, Nairobi, Kenya; Int Ctr Res Agroforestry, Bogor 16001, Indonesia; Brawijaya Univ, Fac Agr, Malang 65145, Indonesia",,"Verchot, LV (corresponding author), Int Ctr Res Agroforestry, POB 30677, Nairobi, Kenya.",l.verchot@cgiar.org,,,,,,,43,43,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 14,2006.0,20.0,4,,,,,,GB4008,10.1029/2005GB002469,,,,,,,,WOS:000242175600001,

This study was conducted to evaluate patterns in an 18-year record of global satellite observations of vegetation phenology from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) as a means to characterize major ecosystem disturbance events and regimes. The fraction absorbed of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) by vegetation canopies worldwide has been computed at a monthly time interval from 1982 to 1999 and gridded at a spatial resolution of 0.5degrees latitude/longitude. Potential disturbance events of large extent (>0.5 Mha) were identified in the FPAR time series by locating anomalously low values (FPAR-LO) that lasted longer than 12 consecutive months at any 0.5degrees pixel. We find that nearly 400 Mha of the global land surface could be identified with at least one FPAR-LO event over the 18-year time series. The majority of these potential disturbance events occurred in tropical savanna and shrublands or in boreal forest ecosystem classes. Verification of potential disturbance events from our FPAR-LO analysis was carried out using documented records of the timing of large-scale wildfires at locations throughout the world. Disturbance regimes were further characterized by association analysis with historical climate anomalies. Assuming accuracy of the FPAR satellite record to characterize major ecosystem disturbance events, we estimate that nearly 9 Pg of carbon could have been lost from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere as a result of large-scale ecosystem disturbance over this 18-year time series.","NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Seaside, CA USA; Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,"Potter, C (corresponding author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",cpotter@gaia.arc.nasa.gov,,,,,,,90,93,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2003.0,9.0,7,,,,1005,1021,,10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00648.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000183796800004,

CO(2) emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (-25%) and perennial crops (-30%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (-9%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29%) or under cropland fallow (+32%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.","[Don, Axel; Freibauer, Annette] Inst Agr Climate Res, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Schumacher, Jens] Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, Jena, Germany",,"Don, A (corresponding author), Inst Agr Climate Res, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",axel.don@vti.bund.de,,,,,,,717,762,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2011.0,17.0,4,,,,1658,1670,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02336.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000287853000013,

Both top-down (atmospheric) and bottom-up (forest inventory and land-use change) approaches have been used to calculate the sign and magnitude of a net terrestrial flux. Different methods often include different processes, however, and comparisons can be misleading. Differences are not necessarily the result of uncertainties or errors, but often result from incomplete accounting inherent in some of the methods. Recent estimates are reviewed here. Overall, a northern mid-latitude carbon sink of approximately 2 Pg C yr(-1) appears robust, although the mechanisms responsible are uncertain. Several lines of evidence point to environmentally enhanced rates of carbon accumulation. Other lines suggest that recovery from past disturbances is largely responsible for the sink. The tropics appear to be a small net source of carbon or nearly neutral, and the same uncertainties of mechanism exist. In addition, studies in the tropics do not permit an unequivocal choice between two alternatives: large emissions of carbon from deforestation offset by large sinks in undisturbed forests, or moderate emissions from land-use change with essentially no change in the carbon balance in undisturbed forests. Resolution of these uncertainties is most likely to result from spatially detailed historical reconstructions of land-use change and disturbance in selected northern mid-latitude regions where such data are available, and from systematic monitoring of changes in the area of tropical forests with satellite data of high spatial resolution collected over the last decades and into the future.","Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,"Houghton, RA (corresponding author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, POB 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",,,,,,,,290,322,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2003.0,9.0,4,,,,500,509,,10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00620.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000182008600003,

Almost all the monkey sera tested had antibodies against malaria blood-stages 98%) and a large majority (73%) also tested positive with the P. malariae/brasilianum circumsporozoite peptide. A number of primate samples also reacted positively with P. falciparum NANP repeats in a very specific manner, suggesting that monkeys in the rainforest are bitten by mosquitoes infected with human malaria parasites. Seroprevalences were lower in the humans tested but Indian tribes on the borders with Suriname and Brazil were clearly more exposed to malaria than other ethnic groups, with a prevalence of nearly 70% seropositivity. P. vivax infections accounted for much of the observed pattern of reactivity, but there was also a high frequency of positive reactions to the P. brasilianum/malariae peptide. Similarly, a large proportion of the sera obtained from Bush Negro populations tested positive for P. malariae/brasilianum repeats. These data add to the emerging evidence that non-human primates might constitute a natural reservoir, not only for simian, but also for human malaria, and therefore suggest that they might be responsible for the maintenance of foci of P. malariae, and possibly of other malaria species, in isolated areas of the Amazonian rainforest.

Caesalpinioideae) forms monodominant forests in the Pakaraima Mountains of western Guyana. Like other tropical monodominants, D. corymbosa has several life-history traits that promote conspecific clumping, in contrast to density-dependent recruitment limitations characterizing most tropical trees. Dicymbe corymbosa forests, occurring in Guyana as patches within a largely non-EM mixed-species forest matrix, are important habitats for a diverse assemblage of EM fungi. Ground-based studies have not adequately determined the regional extent of D. corymbosa forests, nor are they practical due to the rugged, remote nature of the Pakaraima Mountains. We assessed the suitability of Landsat satellite imagery for mapping regional distribution of D. corymbosa forests in Guyana's Upper Potaro River Basin. Supervised image classification was performed on images from August 1989 (Landsat-5 TM) and October 1999 (Landsat-7 ETM+). In situ forest reference data were used to quantitatively assess accuracy of output classification maps. Classification performed well in distinguishing monodominant from mixed-species forests. For both images, D. corymbosa forest class accuracy was good (1989 user's accuracy = 89.8%, K-hat = 0.74; 1999 user's accuracy = 80.7%, K-hat = 0.59). The resulting output classification maps will be useful for planning fungal surveys and ecological studies in forests of the Pakaraima region.

The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) CCM3 general circulation model, coupled with the NCAR Land Surface Model, was used to simulate the effects of this conversion on regional climate. Conversion of savanna to grassland reduced precipitation by approximately 10% in four of the five savanna regions under study; only the northern African savannas showed no significant decline. Associated with this decline was an increase in the frequency of dry periods within the wet season, a change that could be particularly damaging to shallow-rooted crops. The overall decline in precipitation is almost equally attributable to changes in albedo and roughness length. Conversion to grassland increased mean surface air temperature of all the regions by 0.5 degrees C, primarily because of reductions in surface roughness length. Rooting depth, which decreases dramatically with the conversion of savanna to grassland, contributed little to the overall effect of savanna conversion, but deeper rooting had a small positive effect on latent heat flux with a corresponding reduction in sensible heat flux. The authors propose that the interdependence of climate and vegetation in these regions is manifested as a positive feedback loop in which anthropogenic impacts on savanna vegetation are exacerbated by declines in precipitation.","Univ Texas, Dept Bot, Austin, TX USA",,"Hoffmann, WA (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Dept Bot, Caixa Posta 04457, BR-70919970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",hoffmann@unb.br,,,,,,,155,174,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1,2000.0,13.0,9,,,,1593,1602,,10.1175/1520-0442(2000)013<1593:VCFITC>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,WOS:000086905200010,

Empirical results document increases of about 4% in deforestation in the year prior to local mayoral elections on average. Additionally, palm oil plays a crucial role in driving deforestation dynamics. Deforestation rates increase by 7% in places that experience a one standard deviation increase in local price exposure, but no upcoming elections. These effects are amplified to almost 19% larger forest losses in places that experience pre-election years and a standard deviation higher palm oil price exposure at the same time.

This study focused on a widely exploited Neotropical canopy species, Pachira quinata (Malvaceae), at the southernmost, wettest limit of its natural distribution, in the Colombian Amazonia. We studied phenological patterns, seed production and natural densities; assessed the importance of seed dispersal and density-dependent effects on recruitment, using field experiments. At this seasonal forest P. quinata was overrepresented by large adult trees and had very low recruitment caused by the combination of low fruit production, high seed predation and very high seedling mortality under continuous canopies mostly due to damping off pathogens. There was no evidence of negative distance or density effects on recruitment, but a clear requirement of canopy gaps for seedling survival and growth, where pathogen incidence was drastically reduced. In spite of the strong dependence on light for survival of seedlings, seeds germinated readily in the dark. At the study site, the population of P. quinata appeared to be declining, likely because recruitment depended on the rare combination of large gap formation with the presence of reproductive trees nearby.

CASA-3D has the following new features: (1) an alternative approach for calculating absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) using new high-resolution satellite images of forest canopy gap fraction; (2) a pulse disturbance module to modify aboveground carbon pools following forest disturbance; (3) a regrowth module that simulates changes in community composition by considering gap phase regeneration; and (4) a radiative transfer module to simulate the dynamic three-dimensional light environment above the canopy and within gaps after forest disturbance. The model was calibrated with and tested against field observations from experimental logging plots in the Large-scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) project. The sensitivity of key model parameters was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations, and the uncertainties in simulated NPP and respiration associated with model parameters and meteorological variables were assessed. We found that selective logging causes changes in forest architecture and composition that result in a cascading set of impacts on the carbon cycling of rainforest ecosystems. Our model sensitivity and uncertainty analyses also highlight the paramount importance of measuring changes in canopy gap fraction from satellite data, as well as canopy light-use efficiency from ecophysiological measurements, to understand the role of forest disturbance on landscape and regional carbon cycling in tropical forests. In sum, our study suggests that CASA-3D may be suitable for regional-scale applications to assess the large-scale effects of selective logging, to provide guidance for forest management, and to understand the role of forest disturbance in regional and global climate studies.","[Huang, Maoyi; Asner, Gregory P.; Berry, Joseph A.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Keller, Michael] Int Inst Trop Forestry, USDA Forest Serv, Rio Piedras, PR USA; [Keller, Michael] Univ New Hampshire, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA",,"Huang, M (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mhuang@globalecology.stanford.edu,,,,,,,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 10,2008.0,113.0,G1,,,,,,G01002,10.1029/2007JG000438,,,,,,,,WOS:000252362800001,

In addition, it uses an approach to map forest cover for the self-calibrations that is novel to forest mapping with satellite imagery; it maps humid secondary forest that is difficult to distinguish from old-growth forest in single-date imagery; it does not assume that forest age equals time since disturbance; and it incorporates Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery. Variations on the work that we present here can be applied to other forested landscapes. Applications that use image time series will be helped by the free distribution of coregistered Landsat imagery, which began in December 2008, and of the Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) Vegetation Product, which simplifies the use of GLAS data. Finally, we demonstrate here for the first time how the optical imagery of fine spatial resolution that is viewable on Google Earth provides a new source of reference data for remote sensing applications related to land cover.","[Helmer, Eileen H.] US Forest Serv, Int Inst Trop Forestry, USDA, Rio Piedras, PR 00926 USA; [Lefsky, Michael A.] Colorado State Univ, Coll Nat Resources, Ctr Ecol Anal Lidar, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Roberts, Dar A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Helmer, EH (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Int Inst Trop Forestry, USDA, 1201 Calle Ceiba, Rio Piedras, PR 00926 USA.",ehelmer@fs.fed.us,,,,,,,64,67,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 27,2009.0,3.0,,,,,,,33505,10.1117/1.3082116,,,,,,,,WOS:000271867800001,

Parameterisation and calibration for old-growth, regenerating and plantation forests",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Accurate information concerning regional to ecosystem-scale carbon dynamics within tropical rainforests is important because of the increasing certainty that the global climate will change significantly within the next century. Tropical forests of north Queensland, Australia, are highly sensitive to climate change and substantial shifts in the distribution of these forests are likely to occur with minor variations in climate. The focus of this research was the development of a model-based system for assessing forest growth and biomass accumulation dynamics within Australia's tropical rainforest bioregion and predicting the impacts of climate change on these dynamics. This paper presents the parameterisation and calibration of (a) the 3-PG (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth) model to a selection of restored rainforest and commercial timber plantations and (b) a modified version 3-PGS which uses satellite data, enabling the spatial assessment of mature tropical rainforest growth and production throughout the wet tropics bioregion. Statistically significant relationships were observed between 3-PG and 3-PGS modelled and field measured estimates of stand structural attributes including, basal area (BA), diameter at breast height (DBH) and above-ground biomass (AGB) throughout the bioregion. 3-PG and 3-PGS modelled leaf area index (LAI) and net primary production (NPP) related well to published estimates at other similar rainforest sites. These results indicate that the simple, process-based models are effective at capturing the growth dynamics of structurally complex old-growth, restoration and plantation rainforests.

However, neither the extent of human mercury exposure nor its sources and routes have been elucidated. Methods: Total mercury concentrations were measured in samples of fish from Lake Chapala; in sections of sediment cores from the delta of Rio Lerma, the major tributary to the lake; and in a series of suspended-particle samples collected at sites from the mouth of the Lerma to mid-Lake. A cross-sectional survey of 92 women ranging in age from 18-45 years was conducted in three communities along the Lake to investigate the relationship between fish consumption and hair mercury concentrations among women of child-bearing age. Results: Highest concentrations of mercury in fish samples were found in carp (mean 0.87 ppm). Sediment data suggest a pattern of moderate ongoing contamination. Analyses of particles filtered from the water column showed highest concentrations of mercury near the mouth of the Lerma. In the human study, 27.2% of women had >1 ppm hair mercury. On multivariable analysis, carp consumption and consumption of fish purchased or captured from Lake Chapala were both associated with significantly higher mean hair mercury concentrations. Conclusions: Our preliminary data indicate that, despite a moderate level of contamination in recent sediments and suspended particulate matter, carp in Lake Chapala contain mercury concentrations of concern for local fish consumers. Consumption of carp appears to contribute significantly to body burden in this population.

The model was tested in western Honduras where collected and marketed fuelwood is used by the residential sector in both urban and rural settlements.

This study reviews the possibilities and the limits of these four modeling software packages. First, a revision of the methods and tools available for each model was performed, taking into account how the models carry out the different procedures involved in the modeling process: quantity of change estimate, change potential evaluation, spatial allocation of change, reproduction of temporal and spatial patterns, model evaluation and advanced modeling options. Additional considerations, such as flexibility and user friendliness were also taken into account. Then, the four models were applied to a virtual case study to illustrate the previous descriptions with a typical LUCC scenario that consists of four processes of change (conversion of forest to two different types of crops, crop abandonment and urban sprawl) that follow different spatial patterns and are conditioned by different drivers. The outputs were compared to assess the quantity of change estimates, the change potential and the simulated prospective maps. Finally, we discussed some basic criteria to define a good model.

Four 2-ha contiguous permanent plots were erected, one each in Perumakkai shola (site PS), Vengodai shola (VS), Kuzhivalavu shola (KS) and Mottukkadu shola (MS) at 1000, 1050, 1200 and 1250 m elevation, with increasing human disturbance, to evaluate the difference in tree species composition, stand structure and dynamics. This paper discusses the results of the first survey. A total of 3825 individuals and 78 species from 61 genera and 36 families were enumerated in the 8 ha area. Among the four 2-ha sites, species richness was greatest (58) in the undisturbed site PS and lowest (39) in the highly disturbed site MS. Shannon, Simpson, Hill diversity and evenness indexes revealed a progressive reduction in diversity with increasing disturbance. The asymptote species-area curves imply adequate site sampling. Tree density (1151 to 651 trees ha(-2)) and basal area (106 to 46.6 m(2) ha(-2)) decreased from undisturbed to disturbed site, due to selective felling. Single species, Memecylon umbellatum dominated sites MS (39%) and VS (26%), while Nothopegia heyneana, Memecylon umbellatum and Diospyros ovalifolia were dominant in PS, and Meliosma simplicifolia, Myristica dactyloides and Phoebe wightii in KS. Based on species abundance, we classify the study area as Memecylon-Phoebe-Beilschmiedia association with Neolitsea and Myristica as codominants. Tree population structure revealed a step-wise decline in girth frequencies with increasing size class in undisturbed site PS, whereas tree density fell sharp (> 50%) in medium girth class in the disturbed site MS. Population of the dominant species varied widely. The diversity values of this inventory are compared with similar studies in India and other tropical forests. Evidently, the reduction in species richness (by 52%), basal area (56%) and tree density (58%) in disturbed sites, with 57.6% of species rarity of this tropical evergreen forest, in secluded patches ('sholas') of Kolli hills, underlines conservation need to prevent species loss.","Pondicherry Univ, Salim Ali Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India; LNG Coll, Dept Bot, Ponneri 601204, Tamil Nadu, India",,"Chittibabu, CV (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Salim Ali Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India.",partha@pu.pon.nic.in,,,,,,,49,59,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2000.0,9.0,11,,,,1493,1519,,10.1023/A:1008971015545,,,,,,,,WOS:000165248200002,

To determine the desired biological state of a forest indicator baseline values, together with some measure of variability under natural conditions, are needed. A useful Ecological Criteria and Indicator set should, therefore, provide objective standards for evaluation, and these standards should account for spatial and temporal variation in indicator states as well as resilience to anthropogenic disturbance. A framework is presented, within which the standards for assessing ecologically sustainable forest management might be defined. The published literature is drawn upon to determine the responses of selected indicators to natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

Nevertheless, the recent publication of the P. vivax reference genome now allows genomics and systems biology approaches to be applied to this pathogen. We show here that whole-genome analysis of the parasite can be achieved directly from ex vivo-isolated parasites, without the need for in vitro propagation. A single isolate of P. vivax obtained from a febrile patient with clinical malaria from Peru was subjected to whole-genome sequencing (30x coverage). This analysis revealed over 18,261 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 6,257 of which were further validated using a tiling micro-array. Within core chromosomal genes we find that one SNP per every 985 bases of coding sequence distinguishes this recent Peruvian isolate, designated IQ07, from the reference Salvador I strain obtained in 1972. This full-genome sequence of an uncultured P. vivax isolate shows that the same regions with low numbers of aligned sequencing reads are also highly variable by genomic micro-array analysis. Finally, we show that the genes containing the largest ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous SNPs include two AP2 transcription factors and the P. vivax multidrug resistance-associated protein (PvMRP1), an ABC transporter shown to be associated with quinoline and antifolate tolerance in Plasmodium falciparum.

In this study, spatial distribution of total mercury (THg), interspecific accumulation patterns, trophic transfer, and associated health risks in fish of freshwater lakes (357-3107 masl) in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, were investigated. THg concentrations in the regions were 0.20 0.08 mu g g(-1) in glacial, 0.54 0.21 mu g g(-1) in rural, and 1.35 +/- 0.46 mu g g(-1) in urban region. Omnivorous, herbivorous, and carnivorous fish showed THg concentrations of 0.94, 0.85, and 0.49 mu g g(-1). Regional, lake, trophic level, and specie-specific differences of THg accumulation were found significant in the study. Among growth parameters, length and age varied significantly among species, trophic levels, and lakes, whereas weight showed significant variation among lakes as well. Condition factor (K) showed significant differences within species, lakes, and trophic levels. Biomagnification was observed in all lakes with the trophic magnification slopes (TMS) ranging from 0.03 to 0.20 with an average of 0.094 +/- 0.07. Isotopic values of nitrogen (delta N-15) and condition factor were found to dominate THg accumulation trends; however, no significant health risks were found in the study.","[Hina, Nikhat; Riaz, Rahat; Ali, Usman; Malik, Riffat Naseem] Quaid I Azam Univ Islamabad, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Environm Biol & Ecotoxicol Lab, PO 45320, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Rafique, Uzaira] Fatima Jinnah Women Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Rawalpidi 46000, Pakistan",,"Hina, N (corresponding author), Quaid I Azam Univ Islamabad, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Environm Biol & Ecotoxicol Lab, PO 45320, Islamabad, Pakistan.",hinanikhat6@gmail.com; r_n_malik2000@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021.0,199.0,9,,,,3510,3526,,10.1007/s12011-020-02479-z,,JAN 2021,,,,,,WOS:000605536700004,

The accuracy of their diagnosis is influenced by the sensitivity of the method used, whereas neither microscopy nor rapid diagnostic tests allow a satisfactory evaluation of mixed plasmodial infections. Methods: In the present study, the frequency of mixed infections in different part of French Guiana was determined using real time PCR, a sensitive and specific technique. Results: From 400 cases of malaria initially diagnosed by microscopy, real time PCR showed that 10.75 % of the cases were mixed infections. Their prevalence varied considerably between geographical areas. The presence, in equivalent proportions, of the two plasmodial species in eastern French Guiana was associated with a much higher prevalence of mixed plasmodial infections than in western French Guiana, where the majority of the population was Duffy negative and thus resistant to vivax malaria. Conclusion: Clinicians must be more vigilant regarding mixed infections in co-endemic P. falciparum/P. vivax areas, in order to deliver optimal care for patients suffering from malaria. This may involve the use of rapid diagnostic tests capable of detecting mixed infections or low density single infections.

However, most research, pilot-REDD+ projects and carbon certification agencies have focused on deforestation and there appears to be a gap in knowledge on complex mosaic landscapes containing degraded forests, smallholder agriculture, agroforestry and plantations. In this paper we therefore review current research on how avoided forest degradation may affect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and expected co-benefits in terms of biodiversity and livelihoods. There are still high uncertainties in measuring and monitoring emissions of carbon and other GHG from mosaic landscapes with forest degradation since most research has focused on binary analyses of forest vs. deforested land. Studies on the impacts of forest degradation on biodiversity contain mixed results and there is little empirical evidence on the influence of REDD+ on local livelihoods and tenure security, partly due to the lack of actual payment schemes. Governance structures are also more complex in landscapes with degraded forests as there are often multiple owners and types of rights to land and trees. Recent technological advances in remote sensing have improved estimation of carbon stock changes but establishment of historic reference levels is still challenged by the availability of sensor systems and ground measurements during the reference period. The inclusion of forest degradation in REDD+ calls for a range of new research efforts to enhance our knowledge of how to assess the impacts of avoided forest degradation. A first step will be to ensure that complex mosaic landscapes can be recognised under REDD+ on their own merits.","[Mertz, Ole; Fensholt, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geog & Geol, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Mueller, Daniel; Sun, Zhanli] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Dept Struct Change, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Sikor, Thomas; Lestrelin, Guillaume] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Hett, Cornelia; Heinimann, Andreas; Messerli, Peter] Univ Bern, CDE NCCR, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Castella, Jean-Christophe] UMR GRED IRD UPV Montpellier 3, Inst Rech Dev, Viangchan, Lao Pdr, Laos; [Ryan, Casey M.; Reay, David S.; Berry, Nicholas J.] Univ Edinburgh, Grant Inst, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Schmidt-Vogt, Dietrich] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650204, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Danielsen, Finn] NORDECO, DK-1159 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Theilade, Ida; Dons, Klaus] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [van Noordwijk, Meine; Dewi, Sonya] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Bogor, Indonesia; [Verchot, Louis V.; Pham, Thu Thuy; Rutishauser, Ervan] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Bogor 16000, Indonesia; [Burgess, Neil D.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Dept Biol, Denmark & WWF US Conservat Sci Program, Washington, DC USA; [Xu, Jianchu] World Agroforestry Ctr, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Hostert, Patrick; Pflugmacher, Dirk] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Bruun, Thilde Bech; de Neergaard, Andreas] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Agr & Ecol, DK-1871 Frederiksberg, Denmark",,"Mertz, O (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geog & Geol, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",om@geo.ku.dk,,,,,,,68,68,,,,,,,,,,,,2012.0,112.0,1,,,,63,76,,10.1080/00167223.2012.709678,,,,,,,,WOS:000307868200007,

We assessed the impact of certification by comparing the floristic composition of 52 taxa of trees and shrubs in the treefall gaps of certified, conventionally managed and protected forests in northern Honduras. The highest abundance of light-benefiting taxa was found in certified forests, whereas conventionally managed forests were floristically more similar to natural forests. The environmental conditions measured in certified gaps were not favourable for a natural forest floristic composition. Past logging may have altered the species composition in certified forests relatively more than in conventionally managed forests.

Chloroquine resistant P. vivax (PvCR) malaria in the Western Pacific region, Asia and in the Americas indicates a need for biomarkers of resistance to improve therapy and enhance understanding of the mechanisms associated with PvCR. In this study, we compared plasma metabolic profiles of P. vivax malaria patients with PvCR and chloroquine sensitive parasites before treatment to identify potential molecular markers of chloroquine resistance. Methods An untargeted high-resolution metabolomics analysis was performed on plasma samples collected in a malaria clinic in Manaus, Brazil. Male and female patients with Plasmodium vivax were included (n = 46); samples were collected before CQ treatment and followed for 28 days to determine PvCR, defined as the recurrence of parasitemia with detectable plasma concentrations of CQ >= 100 ng/dL. Differentially expressed metabolic features between CQ-Resistant (CQ-R) and CQ-Sensitive (CQ-S) patients were identified using partial least squares discriminant analysis and linear regression after adjusting for covariates and multiple testing correction. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Mummichog. Results Linear regression and PLS-DA methods yielded 69 discriminatory features between CQ-R and CQ-S groups, with 10-fold cross-validation classification accuracy of 89.6% using a SVM classifier. Pathway enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment (p < 0.05) of glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycosphingolipid metabolism, aspartate and asparagine metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, and xenobiotics metabolism. Glyceropho-sphocholines levels were significantly lower in the CQ-R group as compared to CQ-S patients and also to independent control samples. Conclusions The results show differences in lipid, amino acids, and nucleotide metabolism pathways in the plasma of CQ-R versus CQ-S patients prior to antimalarial treatment. Metabolomics phenotyping of P. vivax samples from patients with well-defined clinical CQ-resistance is promising for the development of new tools to understand the biological process and to identify potential biomarkers of PvCR.","[Uppal, Karan; Jones, Dean P.] Emory Univ, Div Pulm Med, Dept Med, Clin Biomarkers Lab, Atlanta, GA 65523 USA; [Cordy, Regina J.; Magalhaes, Belisa; Galinski, Mary R.; Jones, Dean P.] Malaria Host Pathogen Interact Ctr, Atlanta, GA USA; [Monteiro, Wuelton M.; Val, Fernando; Melo, Gisely C.; Galinski, Mary R.] Int Ctr Malaria Res, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Educ & Dev, New Bedford, MA USA; [Salinas, Jorge L.] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA USA; [Uppal, Karan; Lacerda, Marcus V.

To compare the effect of different logging systems on the lianas diversity in tropical rain forest, we recorded all lianas and trees >= 1 cm dbh in two 40-year-old forest sites after clear cutting (CC) and selective cutting (SC) as well as in an old-growth (OG) lowland tropical rain forest on Hainan Island in south China. Results showed that OG contained fewer liana stems and lower species richness (stems: 261, richness: 42 in 1 ha) than CC (606, 52) and SC (727, 50). However, OG had the highest Fisher's alpha diversity index (17.3) and species richness per stem (0.184). Species composition and dbh class distribution of lianas varied significantly with different logging systems. The mean liana dbh in OG (22.1 cm) were higher than those in CC (7.0 cm) and SC (10.4 cm). Stem twining was the most frequent climbing mechanism represented in the forest, as shown by the greatest species richness, abundance, basal area, and host tree number with this mechanism. The percent of host tree stems >= 4 cm dbh hosting at least one liana individual in SC (39%) was higher than CC (23%) and OG (19.5%). Large host trees (dbh >= 60 cm) were more likely to be infested by lianas in SC and OG. Our study demonstrated that logging disturbance could significantly change the composition and structure of liana communities in the lowland tropical rain forest of south China.","[Ding, Yi; Zang, Runguo] Chinese Acad Forestry, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, State Forestry Adm, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China",,"Zang, RG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, State Forestry Adm, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",zangrung@caf.ac.cn,,,,,,,15,23,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2009.0,41.0,5,,,,618,624,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00515.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000269700500015,

We used a simulation model, SELVA, to study (1) the relative impact of demographic factors (juvenile mortality, felling regime) and genetic factors (selfing, number and location of fathers, mating success) on long-term genetic diversity; and (2) the impact of different felling regimes on population size versus genetic diversity. Impact was measured by means of model sensitivity analyses. Juvenile mortality had the highest impact on the number of alleles and genotypes, and on the genetic distance between the original and final populations. Selfing had the greatest impact on observed heterozygote frequency and fixation index. Other factors and interactions had only minor effects. Overall, felling had a greater impact on population size than on genetic diversity. Interestingly, populations under relatively low felling pressure even had a somewhat lower fixation index than undisturbed populations (no felling). We conclude that demographic processes such as juvenile mortality should be modelled thoroughly to obtain reliable long-term predictions of genetic diversity. Mortality in selfed and outcrossed progenies should be modelled explicitly by taking inbreeding depression into account. The modelling of selfing based on population rate appeared to be oversimplifying and should account for inter-tree variation. Forest management should pay particular attention to the regeneration capacities of felled species.","[Wernsdoerfer, Holger] Ctr INRA Nancy, INRA, Lab Etude Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, UMR1092, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Wernsdoerfer, Holger; Cornu, Guillaume; Rossi, Vivien; Gourlet-Fleury, Sylvie] UR Dynam Forets Nat, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Wernsdoerfer, Holger] AgroParisTech, Lab Etude Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, ENGREF, UMR1092, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Caron, Henri; Gerber, Sophie] INRA, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Caron, Henri; Gerber, Sophie] Univ Bordeaux, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Mortier, Frederic] UR Diversite Genet & Ameliorat Especes Forestiere, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",,"Wernsdorfer, H (corresponding author), Ctr INRA Nancy, INRA, Lab Etude Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, UMR1092, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",holger.wernsdoerfer@cirad.fr,,,,,,,13,14,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2011.0,12.0,1,,,,15,29,,10.1007/s10592-009-9983-0,,,,,,,,WOS:000285971900002,

They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these immigrations. The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous tax on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment constitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem-wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a guilty until proven innocent approach would be a productive first step. Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. Left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways.","Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; CSIRO Entomol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; CRC Weed Management Syst, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; UK Ctr Ascot, CABI BIOSCI, Ascot SL5 7TA, Berks, England; Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; Harvard Univ, Biol Labs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Mack, RN (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",,,,,,,,4146,4514,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2000.0,10.0,3,,,,689,710,,10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0689:BICEGC]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,WOS:000087506600008,

Such data are necessary for ecosystem conservation of the under-studied Eastern Ghats, as extensive forests here have already been converted to coffee and orange plantations and the landscape changed due to aluminium ore mining and quarrying. Four 1-ha plots were established in Sanyasimalai (SM) reserve forest of the Shervarayan hills, one plot (SM1) located close to mining and quarrying area, two other contiguous plots (SM2 and SM3) located in selective felling area and the fourth (SM4) in a relatively undisturbed forest. These are 1 to 4 km apart in the same semi-evergreen forest tract. In the four study plots a total of 3260 stems (mean density 815 ha(-1)) covering 80 species in 71 genera and 44 plant families were recorded. Species richness was greatest in the undisturbed plot SM4 (50), while lowest (33) in the selectively felled site SM2. The forest stand (SM4) was also denser (986 stems ha(-1)) and more voluminous (basal area 44.3 m(2) ha(-1) as compared with the site mean of 35 m(2) ha(-1)) than the other plots. Four trees, Chionanthus paniculata, Syzygium cumini, Canthium dicoccum and Ligustrum perrottetii dominated the stand, collectively contributing to >50 % of the total density. Species richness and stand density decreased with increasing tree girths. The forest stand contained a growing population, but there was considerable variation in basal area distribution between the plots. Trends in species population structure varied, particularly for selective-felled species. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25 ha and 1-ha scales. Variation in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts.","Kanchimamunivar Ctr Postgrad Studies, Pondicherry 605008, India",,"Parthasarathy, N (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Salim Ali Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Jipmer Campus, Pondicherry 605014, India.",,,,,,,,53,66,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,1999.0,8.0,3,,,,421,439,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081405400004,

Changes in fire regimes in miombo alter plant growth and functional traits, such as carbon and nitrogen content, specific leaf area (SLA), and the concentrations of polyphenols, which can also change herbivory patterns in these systems. We compared the relative growth rate in height and basal diameter of seedlings and resprouts of Julbernardia globiflora in areas of high and low fire frequency and in the presence and absence of herbivores in Gorongosa National Park. We also measured functional traits (SLA, phenolics) from resprouts and seedlings in high and low fire frequency areas. Overall, resprouts were more responsive to fire frequency than seedlings, perhaps because they may have already survived at least one fire. Resprout RGR in diameter was greatest in areas with a low frequency of fire and where herbivores were excluded. SLA was higher in areas with lower fire frequency, where canopy cover is likely greater. Higher concentrations of polyphenols were measured in seedlings from the high fire frequency area, indicating a greater investment in defenses in vulnerable seedlings. In sum, when fires occur every two years, plant growth was limited, leaves were thicker, and plants invested more in C-rich defenses. Lastly, we observed that Combretum adenogonium, a species favored by fire and not characteristic of true miombo, was more abundant in the frequently burned site, and J. globiflora regenerates more from resprouts than from seed in areas with a short fire return interval. This study suggests that high frequency fires affect miombo conservation, and efforts to prevent frequent fires are important for the integrity of the ecosystem. (c) 2020 SAAB.

These expectations, however, are inconsistent with reality. We conducted multiple field studies in Brazil since the mid-1980s to illustrate the discrepancies between conservation programs and local conditions and expectations. We suggest that public policies and conservation programs should not delegate responsibility for managing protected areas to local and indigenous communities without considering local needs and expectations and locals' attitudes toward conservation. In other words, behavior that maintains or improves the environment should not be treated as traditional based on the expectations of outsiders.

A proposed speckle noise model is also applied for modeling and reducing the speckle noise in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. Reducing the speckle would improve the discrimination among different land use types and would make the textual classifiers more efficient in SAR images. Ideally, filters will reduce the speckle without loss of information. In the process of the forest biomass estimation, the filters should preserve the backscattering coefficient values and edges between different areas. We investigate both quantitative and qualitative criteria in speckle reduction and texture preservation to evaluate the performance of the proposed filter in the forest biomass estimation. We will also show that the biomass estimation accuracy is significantly improved in an MLPNN when the radar and the optical data are used in combination compared to estimating the biomass by using a single datum only.

In the years preceding the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, a flurry of non-state and state actors signed on to various declarations and commitments to reduce deforestation as one globally significant climate mitigation solution. This paper focuses on the Rio Branco Declaration (RBD) and the 30 first-order subnational jurisdictions located in Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Peru that signed it between 2014 and 2018, committing to reduce deforestation 80% by 2020, conditional upon adequate support from the international community. We assess each study jurisdiction's progress toward that commitment in terms of reducing deforestation, and examine a subset of the potential factors supporting or slowing progress, including the existence of commensurate targets within jurisdictions' legal frameworks and the international financial support pledged to jurisdictions. We found that progress toward achieving the target was slow and likely unattainable in most jurisdictions outside of Brazil. Among the four jurisdictions likely to achieve the target under current deforestation trajectories, only Mato Grosso State has a target within its legal framework that is more ambitious than the RBD target. We found that the international response to the RBD was sluggish and likely inadequate - with only one financial pledge made in direct response to the declaration and the majority of funding to support jurisdictional efforts coming from one source. We did not find a clear relationship between international finance pledged and progress toward the RBD deforestation target; however, more often, jurisdictions that received pledges earlier have made more progress. We explore what may explain individual jurisdictions' performance with respect to the target, including specific jurisdictional circumstances, national context, and international support. We estimate that, if current deforestation trajectories continue, the RBD signatories in our study could contribute approximately 3.7% (0.65 GtCO(2)e) of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction needed to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees C, compared with a potential 5.7% (0.98 GtCO(2)e) if they were to all meet the RBD target.","[Stickler, Claudia; David, Olivia; Chan, Charlotta; Ardila, Juan Pablo; Bezerra, Tathiana] Earth Innovat Inst, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA",,"Stickler, C (corresponding author), Earth Innovat Inst, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",cstickler@earthinnovation.org,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 26,2020.0,3.0,,,,,,,50,10.3389/ffgc.2020.00050,,,,,,,,WOS:000551795900001,

This study has integrated two MODIS products (MCD64A1: Burned area and MCD12Q1: Land cover) over Africa and South America from 2001-2013 to explore the vegetation dynamics after fires. The results indicated that while Africa suffered from repeated fires, more than 50% of the total burned area in South America experienced only one fire. The vegetation dynamics of the high-density vegetated regions in the 10 years after a fire showed that the forest losses in the first year after a fire in Africa were slightly larger than that in South America (Africa: 17.2% vs. South America: 14.5% in the Northern Hemisphere). The continental comparison suggested that early successional forests in Africa recovered relatively fast (northern part: 10.2 years; southern part: 12.8 years) than in South America, which recovered (18.4 years) slowly in Northern Hemisphere or ever with no recovery in the Southern Hemisphere. No clear information of the recoveries of other vegetation types (i.e., shrub, grass and crop) in Africa or South America could be identified from the satellite data. In addition, we also analyzed the changes of high-density vegetation in non-burned regions in both continents.

We found that large aboveground biomass (AGB) loss events, which were probably caused by logging, increased DW mass and DOM carbon stock. However, such AGB loss events did not necessarily affect LT masses (i.e., coarse LT [CLT] and fine LT including partly decomposed roots to a soil depth of 5 cm [FLT]). The mean DOM carbon stock and masses of DW, LT, CLT, and FLT during the study period had no significant relationships with AGB in either EF or DF.

In recent years, wood specific gravity, traditionally a forester's variable, has become the domain of ecologists exploring the universality of plant functional traits and conservationists estimating global carbon stocks. While these developments have expanded our knowledge and sample of woods, the methodologies employed to measure wood SG have not received as much scrutiny as SG's ecological importance. Here, we reiterate some of the basic principles and methods for measuring the SG of wood to clarify past practices of foresters and ecologists and to identify some of the prominent errors in recent studies and their consequences. In particular, we identify errors in (1) extracting wood samples that are not representative of tree wood, (2) differentiating wood specific gravity from wood density, (3) drying wood samples at temperatures below 100 degrees C and the resulting moisture content complications, and (4) improperly measuring wood volumes. In addition, we introduce a new experimental technique, using applied calculus, for estimating SG when the form of radial variation is known, a method that significantly reduces the effort required to sample a tree's wood.","[Williamson, G.

However, there have been relatively few studies of the role of riparian forests in tropical landscapes. There is a strong need to evaluate the effects of conversion of these forests to pasture and residential land uses on their ability to prevent the movement of nutrients and other pollutants to coastal water bodies. The objectives of this study were (1) to measure a suite of microbial properties that are indicators of the ability of soils to attenuate pollutants and cycle nitrogen (N) in tropical riparian forests under different land use management and (2) to evaluate the effects of conversion of two types of tropical forested wetlands (cativo, Prioria copaifera and yolillo, Raphia taedigera) on this same suite of soil microbial variables. To accomplish objective #1, we measured these variables in surface soils in intact forest, disturbed forest, pasture and residential land use sites in two locations in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. For objective #2 we measured these variables in surface soils of three replicate intact and converted cativo and yolillo forests. Results suggest that land use conversion does not decrease levels of microbial biomass and activity in these soils. Intact forest sites did not have higher levels of microbial biomass and activity than 'disturbed sites.' In several cases, levels of these variables were consistently lower in intact forest than disturbed sites. There were no statistically significant differences between intact and converted cativo and yolillo sites. The relatively low level of activity in the intact sites is likely a 'succession effect', where the disturbed sites have younger, more actively growing vegetation that supplies more readily available organic matter to the soil microbial community. High correlations between soil organic matter and microbial biomass and activity strongly support this 'successional' explanation of our results. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A comparative analysis of the results indicates that per-pixel based supervised classification produces a large number of 'salt-and-pepper' pixels, and segmentation-based methods can significantly reduce this problem. However, neither method can effectively solve the spectral confusion of impervious surfaces with water/wetland and bare soils and the impacts of shadows. To accurately map impervious surface distribution from Quickbird images, manual editing is necessary and may be the only way to extract impervious surfaces from the confused land covers and the shadow problem.

Total mercury (THg) concentrations in human hair ranged from 0.221 to 3.402 mu g/g and the mean value for the subjects under study was 0.638 mu g/g.

Significant differences in THg were found in the three groups (P<0.05). A multiple linear regression analysis showed a weak but significant correlation of THg content in hair with respect to gender and age, but almost no association was found between THg and dental fillings. Conversely, a strong correlation was obtained between THg and fish consumption regardless of the group evaluated. Finally, mercury levels in hair exceeded the levels corresponding to the EPA reference dose (RID) of 0.1 mu g Hg/kg body weight per day (1 mu g Hg/g hair) in 6% of the population (4% men and 2% women).

However, little is known about the long-term capacity of tropical pastures to sequester C in different soil layers after deforestation. Deep soil layers are generally not taken into consideration or are underestimated when C storage is calculated. Here we show that in French Guiana, the C stored in the deep soil layers contributes significantly to C stocks down to a depth of 100 cm and that C is sequestered in recalcitrant soil organic matter in the soil below a depth of 20 cm. The contribution of the 50-100 cm soil layer increased from 22 to 31 % with the age of the pasture. We show that long-term C sequestration in C4 tropical pastures is linked to the development of C3 species (legumes and shrubs), which increase both inputs of N into the ecosystem and the C:N ratio of soil organic matter. The deep soil under old pastures contained more C3 carbon than the native forest. If C sequestration in the deep soil is taken into account, our results suggest that the soil C stock in pastures in Amazonia would be higher with sustainable pasture management, in particular by promoting the development of legumes already in place and by introducing new species.","[Stahl, Clement; Dezecache, Camille; Ponchant, Lise; Blanfort, Vincent] CIRAD, Joint Res Unit Selmet Trop & Mediterranean Anim P, Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Stahl, Clement] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Freycon, Vincent] CIRAD, UR Bsef 105, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Fontaine, Sebastien; Picon-Cochard, Catherine; Klumpp, Katja; Soussana, Jean-Francois] INRA, UR 874, UREP, Grassland Ecosyst Res Team, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Dezecache, Camille; Ponchant, Lise; Blanfort, Vincent] CIRAD, UMR Ecofog 0745, Campus Agron, F-97379 Kourou, France",,"Stahl, C (corresponding author), CIRAD, Joint Res Unit Selmet Trop & Mediterranean Anim P, Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier, France.; Stahl, C (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",clement.stahl@ecofog.gf,,,,,,,13,14,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2016.0,16.0,7,,,,2059,2069,,10.1007/s10113-016-0936-0,,,,,,,,WOS:000383772100018,

Predicting stand structure parameters for tropical forests from remotely sensed data has numerous important applications, such as estimating above-ground biomass and carbon stocks and providing spatial information for forest mapping and management planning, as well as detecting potential ecological determinants of plant species distributions. As an alternative to direct measurement of physical attributes of the vegetation and individual tree crown delineation, we present a powerful holistic approach using an index of canopy texture that can be extracted from either digitized air photographs or satellite images by means of two-dimensional spectral analysis by Fourier transform. 2. We defined an index of canopy texture from the ordination of the Fourier spectra computed for 3545 1-ha square images of an undisturbed tropical rain forest in French Guiana. This index expressed a gradient of coarseness vs. fineness resulting from the relative importance of small, medium and large spatial frequencies in the Fourier spectra. 3. Based on 12 1-ha control plots, the canopy texture index showed highly significant correlations with tree density (R-2 = 0.80), diameter of the tree of mean basal area (R-2 = 0.71), distribution of trees into d.b.h. classes (R-2 = 0.64) and mean canopy height (R-2 = 0.57), which allowed us to produce reasonable predictive maps of stand structure parameters from digital aerial photographs. 4. Synthesis and applications. Two-dimensional Fourier analysis is a powerful method for obtaining quantitative characterization of canopy texture, with good predictive ability on stand structure parameters. Forest departments should use routine forest inventory operations to set up and feed regional databases, featuring both tree diameter figures and digital canopy images, with the ultimate aims of calibrating robust regression relationships and deriving predictive maps of stand structure parameters over large areas of tropical forests. Such maps would be particularly useful for forest classification and to guide field assessment of tropical forest resources and biodiversity.","Inst Francais Pondichery, Dept Ecol, Pondicherry 605001, India; UMRbot & Bioinformat Architecture Plantes, F-34398 Montpellier, France",,"Couteron, P (corresponding author), Inst Francais Pondichery, Dept Ecol, 11 St Louis St, Pondicherry 605001, India.",pierre.couteron@ifpindia.org,,,,,,,92,94,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2005.0,42.0,6,,,,1121,1128,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01097.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000233515200013,

For that purpose, we analyzed 100 anchovies from the Black Sea and 100 anchovies from the Sea of Marmara, and assessed 25 wholesale workers in fish markets and 25 cleaning firm employees from both Ankara and Istanbul. Mercury levels in samples were measured using a cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Participants were examined neurologically and mini mental state examination was applied to evaluate their cognitive functions. Mercury levels in fish were found to be below the national and international permitted levels. There was no statistically significant relation between mercury levels and the sea from which fish were caught. Hair mercury levels for all participants were within permitted ranges. However, hair mercury levels in both cities increased significantly with amount and frequency of fish consumption. A significant correlation was determined at correlation analysis between levels of fish consumption and hair mercury levels in the fishmongers and in the entire group (r = 0.32, p = 0.025; r = 0.23, p = 0.023, respectively). Neurological examination results were normal, except for a decrease in deep tendon reflexes in some participants in both cities.

Multi-resolution remote sensing (RS) data coupled with additional ancillary topographical layers (both remotely acquired or derived from ground measurements) with appropriate classification strategies would be more effective in capturing LC dynamics and changes associated with the natural resources. Ancillary information would make the decision boundaries between the LC classes more widely separable, enabling classification with higher accuracy compared to conventional methods of RS data classification. In this work, we ascertain the possibility of improvement in classification accuracy of RS data with the addition of ancillary and derived geographical layers such as vegetation indices, temperature, digital elevation model, aspect, slope and texture, implemented in three different terrains of varying topography-urbanised landscape (Greater Bangalore), forested landscape (Western Ghats) and rugged terrain (Western Himalaya). The study showed that use of additional spatial ancillary and derived information significantly improved the classification accuracy compared to the classification of only original spectral bands. The analysis revealed that in a highly urbanised area with less vegetation cover and contrasting features, inclusion of elevation and texture increased the overall accuracy of IKONOS data classification to 88.72% (3.5% improvement), and inclusion of temperature, NDVI, EVI, elevation, slope, aspect, Panchromatic band along with texture measures, significantly increased the overall accuracy of Landsat ETM+ data classification to 83.15% (7.6% improvement). In a forested landscape with moderate elevation, temperature was useful in improving the overall accuracy by 6.7 to 88.26%, and in a rugged terrain with temperate climate, temperature, EVI, elevation, slope, aspect and Panchromatic band significantly improved the classification accuracy to 89.97% (10.84% improvement) compared to the classification of only original spectral bands, suggesting selection of appropriate ancillary data depending on the terrain.","[Kumar, Uttam; Dasgupta, Anindita; Ramachandra, T.

Being transient pools of disturbance-killed trees, coarse woody debris (CWD) stocks play a key role in the carbon budget of such disturbed forests. Here, we investigated for the first time how logging affects the CWD input during and following a fire and, consequently, post-fire CWD stocks. Measurements were made at a permanent site in Bukit Soeharto Education Forest (BSEF) in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. This site consisted of plots that had been subjected to three different logging intensities (HF: heavily felled, trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 30 cm were felled; LF: lightly felled, trees with DBH >= 50 cm were felled; UF: unfelled), all of which were burned by a fire that occurred during a drought associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation in 1998, shortly after logging. CWD mass were measured in 2012, following 14 years of monitoring the CWD inputs. The average CWD mass across the three logging treatments was 89 Mg ha(-1), which is higher than the reported values for undisturbed forests but within the recorded range for recently disturbed forests. The amount of CWD inputs due to tree death during the fire was similar among the three treatments. However, there was a large difference in the CWD input in the post-fire period. In UF plots, large CWD inputs lasted for 2 years following the fire due to delayed tree death, whereas in HF and LF plots, where the above-ground biomass had greatly reduced by selective logging, no further large CWD inputs occurred after the fire. Consequently, the CWD stocks in the HF and LF plots were 50-60% lower than those in the UF plots. A simulation predicted that these CWD inputs during and shortly after the fire still constitute a large proportion of the CWD stocks in 2012, suggesting that the CWD pool is a rather durable carbon store in BSEF. In the HF and LF plots, there was few large diameter CWD pieces, reflecting the selective logging of large diameter trees, whereas, in the UF plots, there were large standing dead and uprooted trees. Since the larger diameter CWD pieces are persist in the forest for a longer time continuing to store carbon and to provide habitats for diverse wild life, selective logging could have large impacts on forest ecology and function not only by decreasing the total CWD inputs and stocks but also by decreasing the large diameter CWD pieces.

We used a before-after design to assess the effect of Georges on N(2)O emissions, and factors likely influencing N(2)O fluxes including soil inorganic nitrogen pools and soil water content in a humid tropical forest at El Verde, Puerto Rico. Emissions of N(2)O up to 7 months post-Georges ranged from 5.92 to 4.26 ng cm(-2) h(-1) and averaged five times greater than fluxes previously measured at the site. N(2)O emissions 27 months after the hurricane remained over two times greater than previously measured fluxes. Soil ammonium pools decreased after Georges and remained low. The first year after the hurricane, nitrate pools increased, but not significantly when compared against a single measurement made before the hurricane.

During this period, dual agricultural frontiers pushed into the region from both east and west, resulting in a production landscape defined by two principal commodities: soybeans and cotton. This article considers the expansion and contraction of these industries and addresses their impacts on the region's forest cover. Findings suggest that the role of cotton and smallholder agriculture has been greatly diminished as a driver of land cover change in the region since 1990.

The project was carried out in the National Park Serra dos Orgaos in the state of Rio de Janeiro, which is one of the largest remnants of continuous forest in this area. This forest is marked by a mosaic of forest types differing in tree composition and structure. Within this heterogeneous habitat the stand structure in three investigation plots was assessed to estimate the above-ground dry biomass (AGB) for all trees with a dbh >= 5 cm. This study indicates the structural diversity of the Atlantic Rainforest. Trees with a dbh > 30 cm were represented by 6% of all sampled individuals (18 out of 318 trees), but contributed 72% of total estimated AGB. The results suggest that big trees in the Atlantic Rainforest may contribute more into total AGB as reported for other tropical rainforests.

Secondary succession in particular constitutes an ecologically and economically important process, driven by and strongly influencing land management and local ecosystem structure and dynamics. As agents of local land management, smallholding farmers in communal, i.e., ejido lands affect rates of forest change, biodiversity, and sustainability within and beyond their land parcels. This research uses household surveys and land parcel mapping in two ejidos located along the buffer of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve to analyze how household socioeconomics and policy institutions drive allocations to successional forests in traditional crop fallows and in enriched fallows. Results indicate that household tenancy, livestock holdings, labor-consumer ratios, and receipts of agricultural subsidies are the strongest determinants of traditional fallow areas. Whereas the latter two factors also influence enriched successions, local agroforestry and reforestation programs were the strongest drivers of fallow enrichment. Additionally, the study conducts field vegetation sampling in a nested design within traditional and enriched fallow sites to comparatively assess biodiversity consequences of fallow management. Although enriched fallows display greater species richness in 10x10 m plots and 2x2 m quadrats, plot-scale data reveal no significant differences in Shannon-Wiener or Simpson's diversity indices. Traditional fallows display greater species heterogeneity at the quadrat scale, however, indicating a complex relationship of diversity to fallow management over time.

Hence, suitable land uses for a climatic condition are expected to sequester optimum atmospheric carbon in soils. But, information on how climatic conditions and land uses influence carbon accumulation in the soils on the Himalayan Mountains is not known. This study reports the impact of four climatic conditions (sub-tropical, altitude: 500-1200 m; temperate 1200-2000 m; lower alpine 2000-3000 m; upper alpine, 3000-3500 m) and four land uses (forest, grassland, horticulture, agriculture) on the concentrations and stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in upper (0-30 cm) and deeper (30-100 cm) soil depths on the western Himalayan Mountains of India. The study also explored the drivers which influenced the SOC stock build up on the mountains. Rainfall and soil moisture showed quadratic relations, whereas temperature declined linearly with the altitude. SOC stock as well as concentration was the highest (101.8 Mg ha(-1) in 0-30 cm, 227.97 Mg ha(-1) in 0-100 cm) in temperate and the lowest in subtropical climate (37 Mg ha(-1) in 0-30 cm, 107.04 Mg ha(-1) in 0-100 cm). Pattern of SOC stock build up across the altitude was: temperate>lower alpine>upper alpine>sub-tropical. SOC stocks in all land uses across the climatic conditions, except agriculture in lower alpine, was higher (0.7 to 41.6%) in the deeper than upper soil depth. SOC stocks in both the depths showed quadratic relations with soil temperature and soil moisture. Other factors like fine soil particles, land-use factor and altitude influenced positively whereas slope and pH, negatively to the SOC stocks. In all climatic conditions, other than temperate, SOC stocks were greater in natural ecosystems like forests and pastures (112.5 to 247.5 Mg ha(-1)) than agriculture (63 to 120.4 Mg ha(-1)). In temperate climate, SOC stock in agriculture (253.6 Mg ha(-1)) on well formed terraces was a little higher than forest (231.3 Mg ha(-1)) on natural slope. These observations, suggest that land uses on temperate climate may be treated as potential sinks for sequestration of the atmospheric carbon. However, agriculture in subtropical climate need to be pursued with due SOC protection measures like the temperate climate for greater sequestration of the atmospheric carbon. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Econometric investigations, over the period 2001-2012, show that forest cover loss is positively influenced by credit and public spending.

Biochars were produced with lab-scale pyrolysis at 550 degrees C, characterized for chemical properties and plant nutrient composition. Further, agronomic efficacy of soil incorporation of biochars (5 t ha(-1)) or co-applied with mineral fertilizers (100, 11, and 62 kg ha(-1) N, P, K, respectively) was tested for sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.

Leucaena can also enhance the soil N status through biological N-2 fixation and easily mineralisation of labile leucaena residues. However, there is limited information on the soil N dynamics of leucaena-grass system especially in the subsoil layers of the soil profile, including the primary N source for leucaena, and the effect of leucaena residue on accompanying green panic (Panicum maximum van trichoglume). We quantified the effect of pasture-type, soil-type and leucaena stand age on soil N stocks and delta N-15 values at different depths. A chronosequence of leucaena stands (0-40 years) and paired grass sites were sampled to 1.0 m depth. Using the delta N-15 natural abundance technique, it was estimated that 73% of leucaena N originated from atmospheric N-2-fixation. Total soil N stocks were 45% higher beneath leucaena rows compared to the paired grass sites at 0-0.1 m depth. In addition, total soil N stocks increased by 32% in the surface at 0-0.3 m depth, attaining a maximum in the 40-year old stand. The N dynamics beneath the leucaena rows and mid-rows suggest a tight cycling of available N within the system.

METHODS Consultations of 182 under-fives by 14 CHWs in Iganga district, Uganda, were observed using standardised checklists. Each CHW saw 13 febrile children. Two paediatricians observed CHWs' assessment, classification and prescription of treatment, while a laboratory scientist assessed CHW use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). The validity of CHWs' use of RDTs to detect malaria and respiratory timers to diagnose pneumonia was estimated using a laboratory scientist's RDT repeat reading and a paediatrician's repeat count of the respiratory rate, respectively. RESULTS From the 182 consultations, overall CHWs' performance was adequate in taking history (97%), use (following procedures prior to reading result) of timers (96%) and use of RDTs (96%), but inadequate in classification (87%). Breath readings (classified as fast or normal) were 85% in agreement with the paediatrician (kappa = 0.665, P < 0.001). All RDT readings were in agreement with those obtained by the laboratory scientist. Ninety-six per cent (85/89) of children with a positive RDT were prescribed an antimalarial drug, 40% (4/10) with fast breathing (gold standard) were prescribed an antibiotic and 91% (48/53) with both were prescribed both medicines. CONCLUSION Community health workers can be trained to use RDTs and timers to assess and manage malaria and pneumonia in children. We recommend integration of these diagnostics into community case management of fever.

The emissions are calculated over the globe at a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution using tree density imagery, and two separate sets of data each for global area burned and land clearing for croplands, along with biofuel consumption rate data. The estimated global and annual total dry matter (DM) burned due to open fire biomass burning ranges between 5221 and 7346 Tg DM/yr, whereas the resultant emissions ranges are 6564-9093 Tg CO2/yr, 438 - 568 Tg CO/yr, 11 - 16 Tg NOx/yr (as NO), and 29 - 40 Tg NMHCs/ yr. The results indicate that land use changes for cropland is one of the major sources of biomass burning, which amounts to 25 - 27% (CO2), 25 - 28% (CO), 20 - 23% (NO), and 28 - 30% ( NMHCs) of the total open fire biomass burning emissions of these gases. Estimated DM burned associated with domestic biofuel burning is 3,114 Tg DM/yr, and resultant emissions are 4825 Tg CO2/ yr, 243 Tg CO/yr, 3 Tg NOx/ yr, and 23 Tg NMHCs/yr. Total emissions from biomass burning are highest in tropical regions ( Asia, America, and Africa), where we identify important contributions from primary forest cutting for croplands and domestic biofuel burning.","Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,"Jain, AK (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 105 S Gregory Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jain@atmos.iuc.edu,,,,,,,44,47,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 22,2006.0,111.0,D6,,,,,,D06304,10.1029/2005JD006237,,,,,,,,WOS:000236345900002,

Mondia whitei (Apocynaceae, formerly Asclepiadaceae), a medicinal liana found in Sub-Saharan Africa, has been subject to intensive harvesting and habitat loss. We surveyed M. whitei in Kakamega Forest, the largest of three remnant Kenyan forests known to contain the species. In 174 100 m(2) plots, we quantified the status of M. whitei and investigated its relationships with land use, disturbance and harvesting. With average adult densities of 101 plants/ha, M. whitei is not locally rare in Kakamega. However, the absence of flowers and fruits, together with a spatial disconnect between adults and juveniles, suggests that sexual regeneration is patchy or infrequent. Comparing among habitat types, we found that plants were most abundant in regenerating indigenous forest managed by the Forest Department, which permits some extractive uses. Conversely, plants were largest in indigenous forest managed by the Kenya Wildlife Service, which prohibits extractive uses. Most anthropogenic disturbances were not associated with M. whitei, but plant occurrence and density were higher along paths used by livestock than along other types of paths. Larger individuals appeared to be preferentially harvested, but adult plants were more likely to occur in harvested plots than un-harvested plots. This work emphasizes that restrictions on disturbance and extractive use do not automatically promote medicinal plant conservation. Moreover, harvesting may have important genetic and demographic consequences that are overlooked by studies focused on numerical losses. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One thousand three hundred sixteen individuals (646 men and 670 women), belonging to 2 tribal and 2 caste groups (from both rural and urban areas), were surveyed for hypertension prevalence. The recommendations of JNC-VI were utilized to classify participants by different categories of hypertension. A substantial proportion (21%) of the individuals exhibited various stages of hypertension. There are considerable differences between these cross-cultural populations, particularly between tribes and castes. The results confirmed the hypothesis that acculturation/modernization may elevate the risk of hypertension, and that prevalence is generally low among traditional population groups. The risk of hypertension increased for those aged 45 years and older, and this risk was greater for women, compared to men.","Reg Med Res Ctr, Bhubaneswar 751023, Orissa, India; Indian Council Med Res, Bhubaneswar 751023, Orissa, India; SE Rly Project Complex, Bhubaneswar 751023, Orissa, India; Andhra Univ, Dept Anthropol, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India",,"Babu, BV (corresponding author), Reg Med Res Ctr, Bhubaneswar 751023, Orissa, India.",babubv@satyam.net.in,,,,,,,24,24,,,,,,,,,,,SPR,2004.0,14.0,2,,,,250,259,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000221035900010,

At least three pediatric populations reside in southern Israel: the Bedouin population, the general Jewish population and Jewish children of Ethiopian origin. Our aim was to compare intestinal parasite prevalence between the three pediatric populations in southern Israel. This is a retrospective, laboratory, population-based surveillance. Most ova and parasite (O&P) tests in southern Israel (hospital and community obtained) are performed by the hospital parasitology laboratory. All pediatric stool O&P tests examined by the hospital laboratory between 2007 and 2011 were included. Overall, 45,978 samples were examined; 27,354, 16,969 and 1655 from Bedouin, non-Ethiopian Jewish and Ethiopian children, respectively. 16,317 parasites were identified in 12,325 (26.8%) positive samples. Total prevalences were 36%, 11% and 46% for Bedouin, non-Ethiopian Jewish and Ethiopian children, respectively. Blastogstis hominis, Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba species were the most common parasites identified, constituting >= 80% of positive samples in all groups. Hymenolepis nana was rarely identified in non-Ethiopian Jewish children (0.04% of isolates compared with 2.6% and 0.5% in Bedouin and Ethiopian children, respectively). Other helminths, excluding H. nana and Enterobius vermicularis, were identified almost exclusively in Ethiopian children >= 5 years of age. In conclusion, the Bedouin and Ethiopian children were characterized by higher parasite prevalence in stool, compared with the non-Ethiopian Jewish children, probably reflecting higher intestinal parasitic disease rates. Certain helminthic infections were identified almost exclusively in the Ethiopian children. These differences may be associated with lifestyle differences between the three populations.

Some research has focused on the potential impacts of sustainable livelihood, and only a few studies have begun considering sensitivity of livelihood strategies. Based on the gradient altitude and resettlement project, mountain settlements are classified into four types: the high-mountain settlement, the semi-mountain settlement, the river valley settlement and the resettlement area. Using semi-structured interviews, we have defined the farm and non-farm livelihood strategies as dependent variables, while the natural, human, physical, financial, and social capitals are considered as independent variables in order to model the relationship between livelihood strategies and livelihood capitals. In term of different settlements, we estimate the sensitivity of farm and non-farm livelihood strategies to livelihood capitals. The results indicate that natural and human capitals exhibited a positive correlation with the farm livelihood strategy, although the effect varies with the four types of settlements. Financial and social capitals are the catalyst for driving non-farm activities. Our findings suggest that no size fits all solutions to the livelihood strategy issues, and only livelihood capitals will be helpful in the long term if they are complemented by relative policies that enhance capital capacity as well as increase access to capitals.

Since we have described the history of these sites based on variations in C-13 natural abundance, patterns of delta(15)N and delta(13)C values were compared to determine if shifts of N-15 correlate with shifts of vegetation. At Menagesha, a > 500-yr-old planted forest, we found delta(15)N values from -8.8 to +3.5 parts per thousand in litter, from -3.5 to +4.5 parts per thousand in 0-10 cm soil layer, and from -1.5 to +6.8 parts per thousand at > 20 cm soil depth. The low delta(15)N in litter and surface mineral soils suggests that a closed N cycle has operated for a long time. At this site, the low delta(13)C of the surface horizon and the high delta(13)C of the lower soil horizons is clear evidence of a long phase of C-4 grass dominance or cultivation of C-4 crops before the establishment of the forest > 500 years ago. In contrast, at Wendo-Genet, high delta(13)C of soils reveals that most of the land has been uncovered by forests until recently. Soil delta(15)N was high throughout (3.4-9.8 parts per thousand), and there were no major differences between forested, cultivated and pasture soils in delta(15)N values of surface mineral soils. The high delta(15)N values suggest that open N cycles operate in the Wendo-Genet area. From the points of view of soil fertility management, it is interesting that tall forest ecosystems with relatively closed N cycling could be established on the fairly steep slopes at Menagesha after a long period of grass vegetation cover or cultivation.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",,"Eshetu, Z (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Zewdu.Eshetu@sek.slu.se,,,,,,,49,57,,,,,,,,,,,,2000.0,222.0,1-2,,,,109,117,,10.1023/A:1004777301260,,,,,,,,WOS:000088041000010,

The number of distinct malaria parasite haplotypes identified from an infected human host at a given time is referred to as the complexity of infection (COI). In this study, an amplicon-based deep sequencing method targeting the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (pfama1) was utilized to (1) investigate the relationship between P. falciparum prevalence and COI, (2) to explore the population genetic structure of P. falciparum parasites from malaria asymptomatic individuals participating in the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and (3) to explore selection pressures on geospatially divergent parasite populations by comparing AMA1 amino acid frequencies in the DRC and Mali. Results: A total of 900 P. falciparum infections across 11 DRC provinces were examined. Deep sequencing of both individuals, for COI analysis, and pools of individuals, to examine population structure, identified 77 unique pfama1 haplotypes. The majority of individual infections (64.5%) contained polyclonal (COI > 1) malaria infections based on the presence of genetically distinct pfama1 haplotypes. A minimal correlation between COI and malaria prevalence as determined by sensitive real-time PCR was identified. Population genetic analyses revealed extensive haplotype diversity, the vast majority of which was shared across the sites. AMA1 amino acid frequencies were similar between parasite populations in the DRC and Mali. Conclusions: Amplicon-based deep sequencing is a useful tool for the detection of multi-strain infections that can aid in the understanding of antigen heterogeneity of potential malaria vaccine candidates, population genetics of malaria parasites, and factors that influence complex, polyclonal malaria infections. While AMA1 and other diverse markers under balancing selection may perform well for understanding COI, they may offer little geographic or temporal discrimination between parasite populations.","[Miller, Robin H.; Stewart, V.

In addition to validating the curve-fit models carbon predictions we used Landsat data to evaluate the degree to which the field inventory plots captured the forest conditions of the study area.

Nine microsatellite markers, consisting of seven novel markers and two markers identified in a related species, were used to characterize the genetic diversity and population genetic structure in three populations of M. zapota collected from reforested, historically urbanized ancient Maya ceremonial centers in Guatemala and Belize, from home gardens in Guatemala, and from a number of cultivars. Levels of genetic variation were slightly higher in forest populations (H-O=0.447) than in gardens (0.430) and cultivated varieties of M. zapota (0.351). We observed low but significant population substructuring (theta=0.01) between sites 90 km apart, and minimal evidence of inbreeding. Substantial levels of genetic diversity with minimal genetic structure in M. zapota are consistent with movement of the ancient Maya as they possibly carried fruits and seedlings during immigration, but they may more likely reflect natural processes such as seed and pollen being dispersed widely throughout the tropical forest.","[Thompson, K.

Understanding of the drivers that have led to changes in land use in these systems and factors that influence the systems' sustainability is useful to guide appropriate targeting of intervention strategies for improvement. We studied low input Teso farming systems in eastern Uganda from 1960 to 2001 in a place-based analysis combined with a comparative analysis of similar low input systems in southern Mali. This study showed that policy-institutional factors next to population growth have driven land use changes in the Teso systems, and that nutrient balances of farm households are useful indicators to identify their sustainability. During the period of analysis, the fraction of land under cultivation increased from 46 to 78%, and communal grazing lands nearly completely disappeared. Cropping diversified over time; cassava overtook cotton and millet in importance, and rice emerged as an alternative cash crop. Impacts of political instability, such as the collapse of cotton marketing and land management institutions, of communal labour arrangements and aggravation of cattle rustling were linked to the changes. Crop productivity in the farming systems is poor and nutrient balances differed between farm types. Balances of N, P and K were all positive for larger farms (LF) that had more cattle and derived a larger proportion of their income from off-farm activities, whereas on the medium farms (MF), small farms with cattle (SF1) and without cattle (SF2) balances were mostly negative. Sustainability of the farming system is driven by livestock, crop production, labour and access to off-farm income. Building private public partnerships around market-oriented crops can be an entry point for encouraging investment in use of external nutrient inputs to boost productivity in such African farming systems. However, intervention strategies should recognise the diversity and heterogeneity between farms to ensure efficient use of these external inputs.","[Ebanyat, Peter; Bekunda, Mateete A.] Makerere Univ, Dept Soil Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [de Ridder, Nico; Giller, Ken E.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Plant Prod Syst Grp, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands; [de Jager, Andre] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, NL-2502 LS The Hague, Netherlands; [Delve, Robert J.] Int Ctr Trop Agr TSBF CIAT, Trop Soil Biol & Fertil Inst, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Ebanyat, P (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Dept Soil Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda.",ebanyat@agric.mak.ac.ug,,,,,,,36,40,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2010.0,31.0,6,,,,474,506,,10.1007/s11111-010-0104-2,,,,,,,,WOS:000279035700005,

As frugivorous primates are important seed dispersers in tropical forests, the reduction of their populations may affect the ecological sustainability of selectively logged forests. This paper is the first to quantify the importance of timber tree species in the diet and nutritional ecology of a primate species. We studied spider monkeys (Ateles chamek) inhabiting a certified forestry concession in Bolivia where post-logging population declines of this species have been recorded. We show that spider monkeys occupying unlogged areas obtained approximately 50% of their total intake of macro-nutrients from timber tree species and exhibited a distinct preference for foraging within trees that were of harvestable size. Timber tree species dominated the spider monkeys' diet both during peak fruiting periods and during periods of fruit scarcity. We estimate that under current timber extraction intensities spider monkeys lose significant proportions of their food sources. Our results indicate that further extraction limits could be considered for Ficus boliviana, Spondias mombin and Pouteria nemorosa. We suggest that to ensure long-term ecological sustainability of certified forestry concessions, the importance of timber tree species in the ecology of seed dispersers needs to be taken into account.

The state of trypanosome infection after a 30-day quarantine period was assessed in 85 squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) and 15 red-handed tamarins (Saguinus midas), that were wild-caught and exported to Japan as companion animals or laboratory animals, for biomedical research, respectively. In addition to many microfilariae of Mansonella (Tetrapetalonema) mariae at a prevalence of 25.9%, and Dipetalonema caudispina at a prevalence of 3.5%, a few trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) minasense were detected in Giemsa-stained thin films of blood from 20 squirrel monkeys at a prevalence of 23.5%. Although few T. minasense trypomastigotes were found in Giemsa-stained blood films from tamarins, a buffy-coat examination detected trypanosomes in 12 red-handed tamarins (80.0%), and PCR amplification of a highly variable region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSU rDNA) for Trypanosoma spp. detected the infection in 14 of the 15 tamarins (93.3%). Nucleotide sequences of the amplicons were identical for trypanosomes from tamarins and squirrel monkeys, indicating a high prevalence but low parasitemia of T. minasense in imported Neotropical nonhuman primates. Based on the SSU rDNA and 5.8S rDNA, the molecular phylogenetic characterization of T. minasense indicated that T. minasense is closely related to trypanosomes with Trypanosoma theileri-like morphology and is distinct from Trypanosoma (Tejeraia) rangeli, as well as from T. cruzi. Using some blood samples from these monkeys, amplification and subsequent sequencing of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) gene fragments detected 4 trypanosome genotypes, including 2 types of T. cruzi clade, I type of T. rangeli clade, and I T. rangeli-related type, but failed to indicate its phylogenetic position based on the gGAPDH gene. Furthermore, species ordinarily classified in the Megatrypanum by morphological criteria do not form a clade in any molecular phylogenetic trees based on rDNA or gGAPDH genes.","[Sato, Hiroshi; Leo, Natalie; Katakai, Yuko; Takano, Jun-ichiro; Akari, Hirofumi; Nakamura, Shin-ichiro; Une, Yumi] Yamaguchi Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Vet Parasitol, Yamaguchi 7538515, Japan",,"Sato, H (corresponding author), Yamaguchi Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Vet Parasitol, 1677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi 7538515, Japan.",sato7dp4@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2008.0,94.0,5,,,,1128,1138,,10.1645/GE-1513.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000260318800018,

However, some of them are subjected to mercury (Hg) contamination, resulting in the ban of human consumption of piscivorous fish. Moreover, beyond predatory fish, little information exist regarding Hg levels in other species of these ecosystems. In this context, we used a food web analytical approach to investigate Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification in relation to the trophic structure of these four lakes. More specifically, various organisms (macrophytes, epiphyton, invertebrates and fish) were collected at the four lakes and analysed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes as well as for total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg). A spatial variability of bioaccumulation in organisms was observed, particularly in carnivorous fish, with higher Hg levels being found in the two more northern lakes (median +/- SE: 3491 +/- 474 and 1113 +/- 209 ng THg.g(-1) dw in lakes HC and L, respectively) than in the southern pair (600 +/- 117 and 911 +/- 117 ng THg.g(-1) dw in lakes CS and PB, respectively). Methylmercury biomagnification was observed through the food webs of all four lakes, with different trophic magnification slopes (HC = 0.16; L = 0.33; CS = 0.27; PB = 0.27), even though the length of the food chains was similar between the lakes. Our results suggest that rather than the food web structure, anthropogenic inputs (sulfate in northern lakes and phosphorus inputs in southern ones) may have a strong impact, more or less directly, on Hg methylation in freshwater environments, and lead to concentrations exceeding environmental recommendations despite low Hg backgrounds in sediment and water.

There is also great interest in recognizing the soil system as a significant terrestrial sink of carbon. The reliable assessment of soil carbon (C) stocks is of key importance for soil conservation and in mitigation strategies for increased atmospheric carbon. In this article, we review and discuss the recent advances in digital mapping of soil C. The challenge to map carbon is demonstrated with the large variation of soil C concentration at a field, continental, and global scale. This article reviews recent studies in mapping soil C using digital soil mapping approaches. The general activities in digital soil mapping involve collection of a database of soil carbon observations over the area of interest; compilation of relevant covariates (scorpan factors) for the area; calibration or training of a spatial prediction function based on the observed dataset; interpolation and/or extrapolation of the prediction function over the whole area; and finally validation using existing or independent datasets. We discuss several relevant aspects in digital mapping: carbon concentration and carbon density, source of data, sampling density and resolution, depth of investigation, map validation, map uncertainty, and environmental covariates. We demonstrate harmonization of soil depths using the equal-area spline and the use of a material coordinate system to take into consideration the varying bulk density due to management practices. Soil C mapping has evolved from 2-D mapping of soil C stock at particular depth ranges to a semi-3-D soil map allowing the estimation of continuous soil C concentration or density with depth. This review then discusses the dynamics of soil C and the consequences for prediction and mapping of soil C change. Finally, we illustrate the prediction of soil carbon change using a semidynamic scorpan approach.","[Minasny, Budiman; McBratney, Alex B.; Malone, Brendan P.; Wheeler, Ichsani] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Natural Resources, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Minasny, B (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Natural Resources, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",budiman.minasny@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,239,242,,,,,,,,,,,,2013.0,118.0,,,,,1,47,,10.1016/B978-0-12-405942-9.00001-3,,,,,,,,WOS:000314252700001,

We studied Hg biomagnification patterns in the food web of Rio Las Marias, an Andean piedmont stream in northern Venezuela, which supports a major subsistence fishery. Mercury concentrations and trophic positions in the food web (based on stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon) were characterized for 24 fish species representing seven trophic guilds (piscivore, generalized carnivore, omnivore, invertivore, algivore, terrestrial herbivore, detritivore). Mercury showed significant biomagnification through the food web, but vertical trophic position explained little of the variation. Muscle Hg concentrations also increased with body mass across the food web. Trophic guild assignments offered a useful alternative to explicit analysis of vertical trophic position; piscivores showed the highest Hg concentrations and terrestrial herbivores had the lowest. There were no consistent seasonal differences in Hg concentrations within the 5 species sampled during both the wet and dry seasons, suggesting that bioavailability is unaffected by strong seasonal variation in rainfall. From a human health perspective, many medium- to large-bodied species that are commonly eaten had Hg concentrations that exceeded International Marketing Limit (IML) (0.5 mu g/g) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (0.2 mu g/g) for consumption. We conclude that Hg concentrations may pose a health concern for local subsistence fishermen and their families. Our results suggest a need to perform risk assessment and better understand contaminant levels in subsistence and commercial fisheries even in areas that lack known Hg point sources.

Using satellite-derived estimates of local deforestation and high-frequency local maize prices across a panel of market catchments across 26 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we find strong empirical evidence that maize price volatility is negatively associated with forest loss. Our findings are driven by catchments in biomes that are relatively well-suited to maize production.

Vegetation and topographical variables including the percentage of the plot burnt and tree abundance were significant predictors of variation in composition. The main compositional gradient showed a clear distinction between subplots in unburnt versus burnt forest. A subset of subplots in burnt forest, however, clustered together with subplots from unburnt forest. These plots were located in a network of relatively unscathed forest along floodplains that persisted in the burnt-forest matrix.

This is richer in C and, overall, more resistant to environmental degradation than the original biomass, and, therefore, PyOM production is an efficient mechanism for C sequestration. The magnitude of this C sink, however, remains poorly quantified, and current production estimates, which suggest that similar to 1-5% of the C affected by fire is converted to PyOM, are based on incomplete inventories. Here, we quantify, for the first time, the complete range of PyOM components found in-situ immediately after a typical boreal forest fire. We utilized an experimental high-intensity crown fire in a jack pine forest (Pinus banksiana) and carried out a detailed pre- and postfire inventory and quantification of all fuel components, and the PyOM (i.e., all visually charred, blackened materials) produced in each of them. Our results show that, overall, 27.6% of the C affected by fire was retained in PyOM (4.8 +/- 0.8 t C ha(-1)), rather than emitted to the atmosphere (12.6 +/- 4.5 t Cha(-1)). The conversion rates varied substantially between fuel components. For down wood and bark, over half of the C affected was converted to PyOM, whereas for forest floor it was only one quarter, and less than a tenth for needles. If the overall conversion rate found here were applicable to boreal wildfire in general, it would translate into a PyOM production of similar to 100 Tg Cyr(-1) by wildfire in the global boreal regions, more than five times the amount estimated previously. Our findings suggest that PyOM production from boreal wildfires, and potentially also from other fire-prone ecosystems, may have been underestimated and that its quantitative importance as a C sink warrants its inclusion in the global C budget estimates.","[Santin, Cristina; Doerr, Stefan H.] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Geog, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Preston, Caroline M.] Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Gil] Univ Oviedo, Dept Stat & Operat Res & Math Didact, Oviedo, Spain",,"Doerr, SH (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Geog, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",s.doerr@Swansea.ac.uk,,,,,,,149,151,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2015.0,21.0,4,,,,1621,1633,,10.1111/gcb.12800,,,,,,,,WOS:000351214100024,

Wildfire alters vegetation structure and composition, affects carbon storage and biogeochemical cycling, and results in the release of climatically relevant trace gases including CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, and aerosols. One way of assessing the impacts of global wildfire on centennial to multi-millennial timescales is to use process-based fire models linked to dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Here we present an update to the LPJ-DGVM and a new fire module based on SPITFIRE that includes several improvements to the way in which fire occurrence, behaviour, and the effects of fire on vegetation are simulated. The new LPJ-LMfire model includes explicit calculation of natural ignitions, the representation of multi-day burning and coalescence of fires, and the calculation of rates of spread in different vegetation types. We describe a new representation of anthropogenic biomass burning under preindustrial conditions that distinguishes the different relationships between humans and fire among hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and farmers. We evaluate our model simulations against remote-sensing-based estimates of burned area at regional and global scale. While wildfire in much of the modern world is largely influenced by anthropogenic suppression and ignitions, in those parts of the world where natural fire is still the dominant process (e.g. in remote areas of the boreal forest and subarctic), our results demonstrate a significant improvement in simulated burned area over the original SPITFIRE.

The concentration of labile organic P, acid phosphatase activity and fine root biomass were greatest in the topsoil (top 5 cm) and decreased with depth, suggesting that the supply of P to plants took place mainly in the topsoil. The amount of total P which was exported out as timber from the ecosystem by heavy selective logging was estimated at 24.0 kg ha(-1), while the amount of labile P in the topsoil was 12.8 kg ha(-1), indicating that the labile P might become deficient by more than 12 kg ha(-1) for biomass recovery.

In spite of this situation, little recent entomological data are available from the main localities where the disease occurs, even though they are crucial for development of an effective vector control strategy. A longitudinal entomological survey was carried out from March 2000-February 2002 in three Amerindian villages, namely Twenke, Taluene and Cayode, located in the Amazonian forest of the Upper-Maroni area, to assess anopheline mosquitoes and malaria transmission dynamics. Anopheles darlingi (Diptera: Culicidae) was the most abundant mosquito species caught during the study. This efficient American malaria vector was active the entire year, but showed an evident peak of abundance during the main rainfall season, from April-June, with an average human biting rate of 255.5 bites per person per night. Parity rates were homogeneous all year, indicating no significant seasonal variability in female survival rates. Estimated vectorial capacity indices were higher during the rainy season, even though the risk of transmission was present throughout the year (VCI > 1). A total of 14 An. darlingi were found infected with Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium malariae. The annual circumsporozoite indices were 0.15, 0.14 and 0.05, and the entomological inoculation rates were 22.8, 27.4 and 14.4 infected bites per person per year in Twenke, Taluene and Cayode, respectively. An. darlingi was endo-exophagic and rather exophilic in these localities. The species was collected throughout the night but was more aggressive between 21:30-03:30 h and after 05:30 h. Parity rates were homogeneous during the entire night. Impregnated hammock and/or bed nets, coupled with the use of mosquito repellents, as well as the early treatment of malarial cases, appear to be the most suitable tools for fighting malaria in these Amerindian villages since the spraying of residual insecticides is inefficient because of vector biology and the housing structure.","[Girod, Romain; Gaborit, Pascal; Carinci, Romuald; Issaly, Jean; Fouque, Florence] Inst Pasteur, Med Entomol Unit, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana",,"Girod, R (corresponding author), Inst Pasteur, Med Entomol Unit, BP 6010, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana.",rgirod@pasteur-cayenne.fr,,,,,,,54,55,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2008.0,103.0,7,,,,702,710,,10.1590/S0074-02762008000700013,,,,,,,,WOS:000261418000013,

We examined a range of soil pools and fluxes during the wet and dry seasons in undisturbed forest, regenerating forest and active agricultural sites within and directly adjacent to Los Haitises National Park. Soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil cations, leaf litter C and pH were significantly greater in regenerating forest sites than agricultural sites, while bulk density was greater in active agricultural sites. Potential denitrification, microbial biomass C and N, and microbial respiration g(-1) dry soil were significantly greater in the regenerating forest sites than in the active agricultural sites. However, net mineralization, net nitrification, microbial biomass C, and microbial respiration were all significantly greater in the agricultural sites on g(-1) SOM basis. These results suggest that land use is indirectly affecting microbial activity and C storage through its effect on SOM quality and quantity. While agriculture can significantly decrease soil fertility, it appears that the trend can begin to rapidly reverse with the abandonment of agriculture and the subsequent regeneration of forest. The regenerating forest soils were taken out of agricultural use only 5-7 years before our study and already have soil properties and processes similar to an undisturbed old forest site.

The watershed includes a pristine area on the hill slopes and a former gold mined flat in the bottomland. Concentrations of dissolved and particulate HgT and MMHg were measured in rain, throughfall, soil water and at three points along the stream. Samples were taken in-between and during 14 storm events at the beginning and middle of the 2005 and 2006 rainy seasons. Dissolved and particulate HgT concentrations in the stream slightly increased downstream, while dissolved and particulate MMHg concentrations were low at the pristine sub-watershed outlet (median = 0.006 ng L-1 and 1.84 ng g(-1), respectively) and sharply increased at the gold mined flat outlet (median = 0.056 ng L-1 and 6.80 ng g(-1), respectively). Oxisols, which are dominant in the pristine area act as a sink of HgT and MMHg from rain and throughfall inputs. Hydromorphic soils in the flat are strongly contaminated with Hg (including Hg droplets) and their structure has been disturbed by former gold-mining processes, leading to multiple stagnant water areas where biogeochemical conditions are favorable for methylation. In the former gold mined flat high dissolved MMHg concentrations (up to 0.8 ng L-1) were measured in puddles or suboxic soil pore waters, whereas high dissolved HgT concentrations were found in lower Eh conditions. Iron-reducing bacteria were suggested as the main methylators since highest concentrations for dissolved MMHg were associated with high dissolved ferrous iron concentrations. The connection between saturated areas and stagnant waters with the hydrographic network during rain events leads to the export of dissolved MMHg and HgT in stream waters, especially at the beginning of the rainy season. As both legal and illegal gold-mining continues to expand in French Guiana, an increase in dissolved and particulate MMHg emissions in the hydrographic network is expected. This will enhance MMHg bio-amplification and present a threat to local populations, whose diet relies mainly on fish. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Information about how conversion of moist evergreen forest to agricultural land uses affects soil nitrogen (N) transformation processes and MB-C in hot humid tropics is meager. The present study explores the following questions: (1) how does conversion of native moist evergreen forest to agricultural production systems (grassland, home garden and silvopasture) affect net soil N mineralization rates, pools of mineral nitrogen (NH (4) (+) - N and NO (3) (-) - N) and MB-C in the hot humid tropical climate of South Andaman, India and (2) are changes in soil N transformations and MB-C related to differences in soil moisture and temperature induced with forest conversion? Variations in net soil N mineralization, NH (4) (+) - N and NO (3) (-) - N pools, MB-C and soil temperature and moisture were measured across wet, post-wet and dry seasons at ten sites of each derived agricultural land use and native forest. In addition, inputs of carbon (C ) and N to the soils and outputs of C and N from the land use systems through harvests were also measured. We measured the N mineralization rate by the buried bag technique using 2 M KCl as an extractant. The NO (3) (-) - N and NH (4) (+) - N were measured at the beginning and end of incubation. The MB-C was measured by a chloroform fumigation-extraction method. We found that forest conversion resulted in a decline in carbon input, but caused rise in soil temperature (from 0.4 to 9.8% across the seasons) in derived agricultural land uses compared to native forest. The soil temperature increase was the highest in the grassland and lowest in the home garden. Across the three seasons, net soil N mineralization rates increased 27 to 55 % in the derived agricultural land uses compared to the native forest, with the increase highest in the grassland and lowest in the home garden. Soil organic C (SOC), MB-C, and NO (3) (-) declined in the derived agricultural land uses relative to native forest, with the greatest effect again seen in the grassland. These observations suggest that native forest conversion to agricultural uses results in lower soil organic C content over time, due to increased mineralization rates stimulated by a rise in soil temperature, and that these soil changes may be most pronounced in grasslands. Therefore, tree based land uses offer good options for soil carbon build up and protection against N loss in the hot humid tropics.","[Pandey, Chandra Bhushan; Singh, G. B.; Singh, S. K.; Singh, R.

Here we present the first intensive study of trace gas fluxes along an elevation sequence of tropical montane forests ranging from 1190 m to 2470 m elevation in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using chamber techniques, we measured monthly flux rates and controlling factors on three elevations, each with three replicate plots for 1 year. Annual N2O fluxes ranged from 0.29 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at 1800 m to 1.01 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at 2470 m and 1.11 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at 1190 m, while annual NO fluxes ranged from 0.17 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at 1800 m, to 0.18 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at 2470 m and 0.48 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at 1190 m.

At the highest elevation, methane uptake was affected by the thick organic layer present at the surface of the soil. Several lines of evidence ( soil N stocks, extractable inorganic N, litterfall mass, litterfall-N and delta N-15 signals in litterfall and soil organic matter) show that the annual N2O + NO emissions could be explained by the inherent N status of these forests. In a test of indices of N cycling to explain N2O and NO fluxes, the robustness of litterfall C/N and litterfall N was confirmed and the delta N-15 signal of litterfall emerged as promising driver for regional and global biogeochemical models that predict N2O + NO emissions from soil.","Univ Gottingen, Inst Soil Sci & Forest Nutr, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; Ctr Int Forestry Res, Jl CIFOR, Bogor 16680, Indonesia",,"Purbopuspito, J (corresponding author), Sam Ratulangi Univ, Fak Pertanian, Jurusan Tanah, Manado 95115, Indonesia.",jpurbop@yahoo.com; eveldka@gwdg.de; rbrumme@gwdg.de; d.murdiyarso@cgiar.org,,,,,,,41,42,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 4,2006.0,20.0,3,,,,,,GB3010,10.1029/2005GB002516,,,,,,,,WOS:000239597200002,

Reliable estimates of aboveground biomass stocks within the Atlantic Forest are rarely available. Past human disturbance is an important factor affecting forest structure variation and biomass accumulation among tropical forest ecosystems. To support the efforts of improving the quality of estimations of the current and future biomass carbon storage capacity of this disturbed forest region we tested a non-experimental small scale approach to compare the aboveground tree biomass (AGB) of forest sites. Three sites with known disturbance histories have been investigated: complete cut down, selective logging and conservation since 70 years. The woody plant community (dbh a parts per thousand yen 10 cm) was censused and canopy openness in conjunction with leaf area index has been obtained by hemispherical photographs at each site. Estimates of aboveground tree biomass have been carried out using an allometric equation for moist tropical forests already applied for the study area. Additionally, a FAO standard equation has been employed for crosschecking our results. We identified significant differences in recent AGB of the three compared forest sites. With 313 (+/- 48 Mg ha(-1)) the highest AGB-values have been found in the preserved forest area within a National Park, followed by 297 (+/- 83) Mg ha(-1) at the former clear cut site. Lowest AGB has been calculated for the area with past selective logging: 204 (+/- 38) Mg ha(-1). Values calculated with the FAO standard equation showed the same trend but at a lower AGB level. Our results based an a small scale approach suggest that biomass productivity can recover in a forest which was completely cleared 60 years ago to reach AGB values up to a level that almost represents the situation in a preserved forest. Selective logging may slow down AGB accumulation and the effect is measurable after several decades.","[Lindner, Andre] Univ Leipzig, Dept Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Inst Biol 1, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Sattler, Dietmar] Univ Leipzig, Dept Phys Geog & Geoecol, Inst Geog, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",,"Lindner, A (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Dept Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Inst Biol 1, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",alindner@uni-leipzig.de; sattler@uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,21,22,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2012.0,43.0,3,,,,287,301,,10.1007/s11056-011-9281-9,,,,,,,,WOS:000303392200002,

Reactive uptake of OH by organic compounds has been observed in a number of studies, but the kinetics of mass transport and chemical reaction are still not fully understood. Here we apply the kinetic multilayer model of gas-particle interactions (KM-GAP) to experimental data from OH exposure studies of levoglucosan and abietic acid, which serve as surrogates and molecular markers of biomass burning aerosol (BBA). The model accounts for gas-phase diffusion within a cylindrical coated-wall flow tube, reversible adsorption of OH, surface-bulk exchange, bulk diffusion, and chemical reactions at the surface and in the bulk of the condensed phase. The nonlinear dependence of OH uptake coefficients on reactant concentrations and time can be reproduced by KM-GAP. We find that the bulk diffusion coefficient of the organic molecules is approximately 10(-16) cm(2) s(-1), reflecting an amorphous semisolid state of the organic substrates. The OH uptake is governed by reaction at or near the surface and can be kinetically limited by surface-bulk exchange or bulk diffusion of the organic reactants. Estimates of the chemical half-life of levoglucosan in 200 nm particles in a biomass burning plume increase from 1 day at high relative humidity to 1 week under dry conditions. In BBA particles transported to the free troposphere, the chemical half-life of levoglucosan can exceed 1 month due to slow bulk diffusion in a glassy matrix at low temperature.","[Arangio, Andrea M.; Berkemeier, Thomas; Poeschl, Ulrich; Shiraiwa, Manabu] Max Planck Inst Chem, Multiphase Chem Dept, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Slade, Jonathan H.; Knopf, Daniel A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Inst Terr & Planetary Atmospheres, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,"Knopf, DA (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Inst Terr & Planetary Atmospheres, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",daniel.knopf@stonybrook.edu; m.shiraiwa@mpic.de,,,,,,,71,71,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 14,2015.0,119.0,19,,,,4533,4544,,10.1021/jp510489z,,,,,,,,WOS:000354911000027,

New reclamation methods are being employed with the intent of restoring native forest on Appalachian mined lands. Mine soil construction is essential to the reforestation process. Here, we review scientific literature concerning selection of mining materials for mine soil construction where forest ecosystem restoration is the reclamation goal. Successful establishment and productive growth of native Appalachian trees has been documented on mine soils with coarse fragment contents as great as 60% but with low soluble salt levels and slightly to moderately acidic pHs, properties characteristic of the region's native soils. Native tree productivity on some Appalachian mined lands where weathered rock spoils were used to reconstruct soils was found comparable to productivity on native forest sites. Weathered rock spoils, however, are lower in bioavailable N and P than native Appalachian soils and they lack live seed banks which native soils contain. The body of scientific research suggests use of salvaged native soils for mine soil construction when forest ecosystem restoration is the reclamation goal, and that weathered rock spoils are generally superior to unweathered rock spoils when constructing mine soils for this purpose.","[Zipper, Carl E.; Burger, James A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Barton, Christopher D.] Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Skousen, Jeffrey G.] W Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",,"Zipper, CE (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",czip@vt.edu,,,,,,,45,48,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2013.0,77.0,2,,,,337,349,,10.2136/sssaj2012.0335,,,,,,,,WOS:000322827900001,

Studies on the effects of land use changes and land use intensification on soil trace gas emissions were mostly conducted in Latin America and only very few in Asia. Here we present results from Central Sulawesi where profound changes in land use and cultivation practices take place: traditional agricultural practices like shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn agriculture are replaced by permanent cultivation systems and introduction of income-generating cash crops like cacao. Our results showed that N2O emissions were higher from cacao agroforestry (35 +/- 10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) than maize (9 +/- 2 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)), whereas intermediate rates were observed from secondary forests (25 +/- 11 mg N m(-2) h(-1)). NO emissions did not differ among land use systems, ranging from 12 +/- 2 mg N m(-2) h(-1) for cacao agroforestry and secondary forest to 18 +/- 2 mg N m(-2) h(-1) for maize. CH4 uptake was higher for maize (-30 +/- 4 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) than cacao agroforestry (-18 +/- 2 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) and intermediate rates were measured from secondary forests (-25 +/- 4 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)). Combining these data with results from other studies in this area, we present chronosequence effects of land use change on trace gas emissions from natural forest, through maize cultivation, to cacao agroforestry (with or without fertilizer). Compared to the original forests, this typical land use change in the study area clearly led to higher N2O emissions and lower CH4 uptake with age of cacao agroforestry systems. We conclude that this common land use sequence in the area combined with the increasing use of fertilizer will strongly increase soil trace gas emissions. We suggest that the future hot spot regions of high N2O (and to a lesser extend NO) emissions in the tropics are those areas where climatic and edaphic conditions allow for intensive agriculture. This scenario is probably preferable over the alternative of agriculture extensification, which would imply a dramatic increase in deforestation rates with accompanying CO2 emissions.","[Veldkamp, Edzo; Purbopuspito, Joko; Corre, Marife D.; Brumme, Rainer] Univ Gottingen, Buesgen Inst, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany; [Murdiyarso, Daniel] Jalan CIFOR, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Bogor, Indonesia",,"Veldkamp, E (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Buesgen Inst, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany.",eveldka@gwdg.de,,,,,,,41,41,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2,2008.0,113.0,G2,,,,,,G02003,10.1029/2007JG000522,,,,,,,,WOS:000254717400002,

Logging is one of the main drivers of road construction in tropical forests. We evaluated forest fragmentation and impacts of logging roads on forest resilience and wildlife, considering the full life cycle of logging roads. Through an extensive evidence review we found that for logging road construction, corridors between 3 and 66m (median 20m) width are cleared, leading to a loss of 0.6-8.0 percent (median 1.7%) of forest cover. More severe impacts are increased fire incidence, soil erosion, landslides, and sediment accumulation in streams. Once opened, logging roads potentially allow continued access to the forest interior, which can lead to biological invasions, increased hunting pressure, and proliferation of swidden agriculture. Some roads, initially built for logging, become converted to permanent, public roads with subsequent in-migration and conversion of forest to agriculture. Most logging roads, however, are abandoned to vegetation recovery. Given the far-reaching impacts of the roads that become conduits for human access, its control after the end of logging operations is crucial.

Biomass turnover time is a crucial parameter in the global carbon cycle(2-4), and contributes to the feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate(2-7). Biomass turnover time varies substantially in time and space, but its determinants are not well known(8,9), making predictions of future global carbon cycle dynamics uncertain(5,10-13). Land use-the sum of activities that aim at enhancing terrestrial ecosystem services(14)-alters plant growth(15) and reduces biomass stocks(16), and is hence expected to affect biomass turnover. Here we explore land-use-induced alterations of biomass turnover at the global scale by comparing the biomass turnover of the actual vegetation with that of a hypothetical vegetation state with no land use under current climate conditions. We find that, in the global average, biomass turnover is 1.9 times faster with land use. This acceleration affects all biomes roughly equally, but with large differences between land-use types. Land conversion, for example from forests to agricultural fields, is responsible for 59% of the acceleration; the use of forests and natural grazing land accounts for 26% and 15% respectively. Reductions in biomass stocks are partly compensated by reductions in net primary productivity. We conclude that land use significantly and systematically affects the fundamental trade-off between carbon turnover and carbon stocks.","[Erb, Karl-Heinz; Fetzel, Tamara; Plutzar, Christoph; Kastner, Thomas; Lauk, Christian; Mayer, Andreas; Niedertscheider, Maria; Haberl, Helmut] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt Vienna Graz, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Plutzar, Christoph] Univ Vienna, Div Conservat Biol Vegetat Ecol & Landscape Ecol, Rennweg 14, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Koerner, Christian] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",,"Erb, KH (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt Vienna Graz, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",karlheinz.erb@aau.at,,,,,,,74,74,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2016.0,9.0,9,,,,674,+,,10.1038/NGEO2782,,,,,,,,WOS:000383283700010,

Since the ecological integrity of wetlands strongly depends on their water sources and dynamics, it is fundamental to understand their hydrology. Large wetlands are usually located in inaccessible areas where remote sensing results are a fundamental tool for wetland monitoring, providing information over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. Radar spaceborne sensors provide an excellent all-weather tool for monitoring and recent investigations have also shown that Interferometric SAR (InSAR) can be very valuable for wetland monitoring in addition to its regular uses in DEM generation and surface deformation analyses. The availability of new SAR satellites such as the Sentinel 1 and SAOCOM missions, with short revisit times and open data policies, repeat-pass interferometry can now provide long time-series of coherence for wetland monitoring. In this article, we used a SOM neural network to cluster a yearly series of Sentinel 1 B coherence images from the coastal plain of Samboromb'on Bay, Argentina, into temporal coherence patterns. The timing and coherence values of these patterns were interpreted in terms of landcover, vegetation phenology, water sources, and waterlogged condition. Although the SOM patterns did not show a one to one relationship with landcover types nor with the main water sources, their spatial distribution and temporal signature of coherence gave information on wetlands with different water dynamics. A key outcome of our study was that temporal patterns of coherence could be used to assess the impacts of land-use practices on wetland functioning, which deserves further exploration. The spatial distribution of the temporal coherence patterns can be used as a hypothesis for wetland hydropatterns, a key to hydrological functional type wetland classification. This approach can help us gain a better understanding of complex wetlands and foster their sustainable management, particularly combined with in situ fieldwork and other remote sensing sources, particularly repeat pass L-band coherence, which can give a better indication of soil wetness.","[Minotti, Priscilla Gail] UNSAM, Inst Invest & Ingn Ambiental, 3iA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rajngewerc, Mariela; Santoro, Vanesa Ali; Grimson, Rafael] UNSAM, Inst Invest & Ingn Ambiental, CONICET, IIIA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Minotti, PG (corresponding author), UNSAM, Inst Invest & Ingn Ambiental, 3iA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",pminotti@unsam.edu.ar,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2021.0,106.0,,,,,,,102976,10.1016/j.jsames.2020.102976,,JAN 2021,,,,,,WOS:000612744600001,

Each of these issues is discussed with emphasis placed on the potential to increase the level of information extraction beyond that derived with conventional approaches in order to more usefully inform sustainable development practices.","Univ Southampton, Dept Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",,"Foody, GM (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Dept Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",,,,,,,,118,127,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2003.0,24.0,20,,,,4035,4046,,10.1080/0143116031000103853,,,,,,,,WOS:000185823000011,

The review summarizes recent estimates on changes in cropland, agricultural intensification, tropical deforestation, pasture expansion, and urbanization and identifies the still unmeasured land-cover changes. Climate-driven land-cover modifications interact with land-use changes. Land-use change is driven by synergetic factor combinations of resource scarcity leading to an increase in the pressure of production on resources, changing opportunities created by markets, outside policy intervention, loss of adaptive capacity, and changes in social organization and attitudes. The changes in ecosystem goods and services that result from land-use change feed back on the drivers of land-use change. A restricted set of dominant pathways of land-use change is identified. Land-use change can be understood using the concepts of complex adaptive systems and transitions. Integrated, place-based research on land-use/land-cover change requires a combination of the agent-based systems and narrative perspectives of understanding. We argue in this paper that a systematic analysis of local-scale land-use change studies, conducted over a range of timescales, helps to uncover general principles that provide an explanation and prediction of new land-use changes.","Univ Louvain, Dept Geog, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; Univ Louvain, Dept Geog, LUCC Int Project Off, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",,"Lambin, EF (corresponding author), Univ Louvain, Dept Geog, Pl Louis Pasteur 3, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",lambin@geog.ucl.ac.be; geist@geog.ucl.ac.be; lepers@geog.ucl.ac.be,,,,,,,1096,1181,,,,,,,,,,,,2003.0,28.0,,,,,205,241,,10.1146/annurev.energy.28.050302.105459,,,,,,,,WOS:000220102700007,

Rarely do these monitoring projects propose solutions to eliminate the use of mercury in AGM. Rather, they focus on the assessment of associated health or environmental impacts, demonstrations of cleaner techniques to extract gold and legal actions to formalize artisanal miners. Those approaches have not resulted in mercury reduction or elimination. This paper is an overview of the observations made by the first author in over 40 years of intensive research and field projects across 35 countries. To date, projects to eliminate mercury in gold processing have been predominantly unsuccessful mainly due to the lack of continuity and misplaced objectives. This paper reviews the attempts to eliminate mercury use in AGM. The co-existence of artisanal miners with the owners of the mineral titles (e.g. conventional mining companies) is successfully gaining momentum and has been witnessed in the field. Although different co -existence models are discussed in this review, we suggest a minor modification of the technique to improve the relationship between the miners and ore-processing companies. Essentially, our proposed co-existence model implies that the miners mine while the processors process.","[Veiga, Marcello M.; Fadina, Omotayo] Univ British Columbia, Norman B Keevil Inst Min Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada",,"Veiga, MM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Norman B Keevil Inst Min Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",veiga@mining.ubc.ca,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2020.0,7.0,3,,,,1135,1146,,10.1016/j.exis.2020.06.023,,,,,,,,WOS:000566718900008,

This promise, however, does not materialize automatically. The key question addressed by this article is how a green transformation can be successful as an alternative to a more conventional growth-oriented development strategy. The analysis of policies and case study evidence shows that it must satisfy two important criteria. First, to be relevant to low and middle-income economies, green growth must be compatible with the most important development goal, which is poverty alleviation, and second, it must be accompanied by policies that address the key structural features of natural resource use and poverty in these countries. These criteria are especially relevant for green rural transformation in poor countries. Improving the efficiency and sustainability of primary production for economy-wide gains entails resource-enhancing technological change in primary production activities, strong forward and backward linkages between the resource-based primary production sector and the rest of the economy, and substantial knowledge spillovers in primary production and across resource-based activities. Controlling land use expansion by commercial primary product activities requires a combination of environmental regulations to control deforestation, regional policies that encourage agglomeration economies, and market-based incentives to reduce forest loss and degradation. Targeting research, extension, marketing services, and land tenure arrangements to improve the livelihoods of the rural poor in remote land-abundant regions also show promise. Facilitating greater dissemination and adoption of renewable energy and improved energy efficiency technologies in rural areas also depends on overcoming key obstacles, such as the lack of long-term financing schemes, poor private sector participation, inadequate institutional structure, lack of coordination between local and national governments, and the weak purchasing power of rural communities.

The management decisions that these owners and collectives make aggregate into measurable impacts on forest cover, fragmentation, carbon storage, biodiversity, and on the ecosystem services these forests provide to owners and broader society. Conversely, large scale processes such as climate change, globalization of markets, changes to laws regarding land tenure and access, and labor migration and remittances dramatically affect individual forest owners and the activities they are able to do on their land. Using NVivo 11.0, I coded and analyzed 456 papers describing research in the intersection of private or communal owners, forests, and landscape-scale impacts or influences. This analysis identified several prominent themes. Forested landscapes are increasingly split into smaller managed segments among more owners, in some cases facilitating deforestation. Global-scale processes such as labor migration and globalized forest product systems influence management decisions of family forest owners in most countries, particularly the choice of growing exotic species plantations and converting forests to cash crops. Programs and policies aimed at family and communal forest owners can be better targeted to incentivize these owners to protect and enhance forest benefits for broader society, and to better support owners' adaptations to climate change, invasive species, biodiversity loss, and population demographics. Forest-based tourism and non-timber forest products are important but undervalued incentives for forest conservation. Given the large proportion of forests owned and managed by smallholders, landscape-scale planning and conservation goals cannot be met without engaging these forest owners.","[Mayer, Audrey L.] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",,"Mayer, AL (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",almayer@mtu.edu,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019.0,188.0,,,,,4,18,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.10.017,,,,,,,,WOS:000471355600002,

Causes of tropical fires are widely documented, although research contributions are from many disciplines, and each tends to focus on specific facets of a research problem, which might limit understanding of fire as a complex social-ecological system. We conducted a systematic review to (1) examine geographic and methodological focus in tropical fire research; (2) identify which types of landholders are the focus of the research effort; (3) test for a research method effect on the variables, e. g., socio-political, economic, and climatic, identified as causes of and proposed management solutions to tropical fire; and (4) examine relationships between causal factors and proposed solutions. Results from 51 studies show distinct geographic and methodological tendencies in the literature. Few studies explicitly identify landholder types, and no social studies focused on large-landholders. Multiple drivers and potential solutions to preventing fire are identified and the research approach adopted had the strongest influence on the socioeconomic, direct fire management and landscape characteristics variables. There was an overall mismatch between identified cause and proposed management solution. These findings indicate that mixed method approaches are imperative to understanding the coupled human-nature system of fire and to improve rural development and management strategies to curtail tropical fire spread.","[Carmenta, Rachel; Parry, Luke; Blackburn, Alan; Vermeylen, Saskia; Barlow, Jos] Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, Lancs, England; [Carmenta, Rachel] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bagor, Indonesia",,"Carmenta, R (corresponding author), Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,49,50,,,,,,,,,,,,2011.0,16.0,1,,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,WOS:000289081200044,

Modern-day agricultural frontiers, however, are increasingly driven by capitalized corporate agriculture operating with little direct government intervention. The expansion of contemporary frontiers has been explained by the existence of spatially heterogeneous abnormal rents, which can be caused by cheap land and labor, technological innovation, lack of regulations, and a variety of other incentives. Here, we argue that understanding the dynamics of these frontiers requires considering the differential ability of actors to capture such rents, which depends on their access to production factors and their information, preferences, and agency. We propose a new conceptual framework drawing on neoclassical economics and political economy, which we apply to the South American Gran Chaco, a hot spot of deforestation for soy and cattle production. We divide the region into a set of distinct frontiers based on satellite data, field interviews, and expert knowledge, to review the drivers and actors of agricultural expansion in these frontiers. We show that frontier expansion in the Chaco responded to the rents created by new agricultural technologies, infrastructure, and rising producer prices but that the frontier dynamics were strongly influenced by actors' abilities to capture or influence these rents. Our findings thus highlight that understanding contemporary commodity frontiers requires analyzing the novel ways by which the agency of particular groups of actors shapes land-use outcomes.","[de Waroux, Yann le Polain] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [de Waroux, Yann le Polain] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Baumann, Matthias; Kuemmerle, Tobias] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Gasparri, Nestor Ignacio] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Inst Ecol Reg, CP 4107 Yerba Buena, San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Gasparri, Nestor Ignacio] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Gavier-Pizarro, Gregorio] INTA, IRB, Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Godar, Javier] Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Vazquez, Fabricio] Univ Nacl Asuncion, San Lorenzo, Paraguay; [Volante, Jose Norberto] INTA, Lab Teledetecc & SIG, Cerrillos, Salta, Argentina; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] Catholic Univ Louvain, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",,"de Waroux, YL (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; de Waroux, YL (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",yann.lepolaindewaroux@mcgill.ca; matthias.baumann@geo.hu-berlin.de; ignacio.gasparri@gmail.com; ggavier@yahoo.com; javier.godar@sei-international.org; tobias.kuemmerle@hu-berlin.de; robemule@yahoo.com; fabricio.vazquez@gmail.com; volante.jose@inta.gob.ar; patrick.meyfroidt@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,54,54,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,108.0,1,,,,204,225,,10.1080/24694452.2017.1360761,,,,,,,,WOS:000423809600012,

GWEM computes monthly emissions of more than 40 chemical compounds and aerosols from forest and savanna fires. This study focuses on an evaluation of the GLOBSCAR data set. The GWEM version presented here makes use of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover map. Emission totals for the year 2000 are 1741 Tg C, 5716 Tg CO2, 271 Tg CO, 12.52 Tg CH4, 9.09 Tg C (as nonmethane hydrocarbons), 8.08 Tg NOx (as NO), 24.30 Tg PM2.5, 15.80 Tg OC, and 1.84 Tg black carbon. These emissions are lower than other estimates found in literature. An evaluation assesses the uncertainties of the individual input data. The GLOBSCAR product yields reasonable estimates of burnt area for large wildland fires in most parts of the globe but experiences problems in some regions where small fires dominate. The seasonality derived from GLOBSCAR differs from other satellite products detecting active fires owing to the different algorithms applied. Application of the presented GWEM results in global chemistry transport modeling will require additional treatment of small deforestation fires in the tropical rain forest regions and small savanna fires, mainly in subequatorial Africa. Further improvements are expected from a more detailed description of the carbon pools and the inclusion of anthropogenic disturbances in the LPJ model.","Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; European Space Agcy, ESRIN, I-00044 Frascati, Italy; Univ Paris 06, Serv Aeron, Paris, France; NOAA, Aeron Lab, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80303 USA",,"Hoelzemann, JJ (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",hoelzemann@dkrz.de,,,,,,,183,191,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 5,2004.0,109.0,D14,,,,,,D14S04,10.1029/2003JD003666,,,,,,,,WOS:000221953900001,

To assess contributions of C4 and C3 plants (from pasture and forest vegetation cover, respectively) to particulates exported from Pacific Panama watersheds, we measured C-13 and N-15 in suspended particulate matter (SPM) within eight mangrove estuaries whose watersheds differed in degree of conversion from forest to pasture land cover. These measurements also allowed evaluation of down-estuary transformations and the relative marine influence on transport and exchanges of particles between land, estuary, and sea. Imprint of watershed mosaic was detectable in C-13 of SPM within upper reaches of estuaries but disappeared down-estuary. Detectably heavier C-13 suggested that C4 plants contributed to SPM in upper reaches of estuaries. C-13 signatures were sufficiently sensitive to reveal presence of a small, but still detectable, contribution by C4 grasses to SPM. Influence of heavier marine-derived sources increased down-estuary, erasing terrestrial imprints. C-13 and N-15 in SPM, and in mangrove species present, became enriched down-estuary, likely from increased inputs of particulates bearing heavier signatures from upwelled waters.

Thirty field plots were established in three types of lowland rainforests: alluvial, sandstone hill and heath forests that represent a wide range of AGB density and stand structure. We derived the height percentile and laser penetration variables from the airborne LiDAR and calculated the vegetation indices, tasseled cap transformation values, and the texture measures from Landsat 8 OLI data. We found that there are moderate correlations between the AGB and laser penetration variables from airborne LiDAR data (r = -0.411 to -0.790). For Landsat 8 OLI data, the 6 vegetation indices and the 46 texture measures also significantly correlated with the AGB (r = 0.366-0.519). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to establish the estimation models for independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI data.

Honduras and the other countries of Mesoamerica and the island of Hispaniola have set the goal of eliminating native malaria by the year 2020. To achieve this goal, Honduras has recently approved national regulations to expand the possibilities of a shortened double dose primaquine (PQ) treatment for vivax malaria. Considering this new shortened anti-malarial treatment, the high frequency of G6PDd genotypes in Honduras, and the lack of routinely assessment of the G6PD deficiency status, this study aimed at investigating the potential association between the intake of PQ and haemolysis in malaria-infected G6PDd subjects.MethodsThis was a prospective cohort and open-label study. Participants with malaria were recruited. Plasmodium vivax infection was treated with 0.25mg/kg of PQ daily for 14days. Safety and signs of haemolysis were evaluated by clinical criteria and laboratory values before and during the 3rd and 7th day of PQ treatment. G6PD status was assessed by a rapid test (CareStart) and two molecular approaches.ResultsOverall 55 participants were enrolled. The frequency of G6PD deficient genotypes was 7/55 (12.7%), where 5/7 (71.4%) were hemizygous A-males and 2/7 (28.6%) heterozygous A-females. Haemoglobin concentrations were compared between G6PD wild type (B) and G6PDd A-subjects, showing a significant difference between the means of both groups in the 3rd and 7th days. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference was evident in the change in haemoglobin concentration between the 3rd day and the 1st day for both genotypes, but there was no statistical difference for the change in haemoglobin concentration between the 7th day and the 1st day. Besides these changes in the haemoglobin concentrations, none of the patients showed signs or symptoms associated with severe haemolysis, and none needed to be admitted to a hospital for further medical attention.ConclusionsThe findings support that the intake of PQ during 14days of treatment against vivax malaria is safe in patients with a class III variant of G6PDd. In view of the new national regulations in the shortened treatment of vivax malaria for 7days, it is advisable to be alert of potential cases of severe haemolysis that could occur among G6PD deficient hemizygous males with a class II mutation such as the Santamaria variant, previously reported in the country.","[Avalos, Sara; Pinto, Alejandra; Mejia, Angel; Fontecha, Gustavo] Natl Autonomous Univ Honduras, Microbiol Res Inst, Tegucigalpa, Honduras; [Mejia, Rosa E.] Pan Amer Hlth Org, Tegucigalpa, Honduras; [Banegas, Engels; Salinas, Cesar; Gutierrez, Lester; Fajardo, Marcela; Galo, Suzeth] Minist Hlth, Natl Dept Surveillance, Tegucigalpa, Honduras",,"Fontecha, G (corresponding author), Natl Autonomous Univ Honduras, Microbiol Res Inst, Tegucigalpa, Honduras.",gustavo.fontecha@unah.edu.hn,,,,,,,7,8,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 8,2018.0,17.0,,,,,,,415,10.1186/s12936-018-2564-2,,,,,,,,WOS:000449822000002,

Multi-sensor optical and radar detection and ranging (radar) remote sensing data combined with active fire alerts shows the potential for a more in-depth characterization of fire-related forest disturbances. We utilized dense optical (Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) time series to individually map forest disturbances in the province of Riau (Indonesia) for 2018-2019. We combined the sensor-specific optical and radar forest disturbance maps with daily active fire alerts and classified their temporal relationship (predating, coinciding, postdating) into seven so-called archetypes of fire-related forest disturbances. The archetypes reflect sensor-specific sensitives of optical (e.g., changes in tree foliage) and radar (e.g., changes in tree structure) data to detect varying types of forest disturbances, ranging from either a loss of tree foliage and/or structure predating, coinciding or postdating fires. These can be related to different magnitudes of fire-related forest disturbances and burn severities and can be associated with specific land management practices, such as slash-and-burn agriculture and salvage logging. This can support policy development, local and regional forest management and law enforcement to reduce illegal fire usage in the tropics. Results suggest that a delayed or opposing forest disturbance detection in the optical and radar signal is not only caused by environmental influences or different observation densities but, in some cases, such as fire-related forest disturbances, can be related to their different sensitives to detect changes in tree foliage and structure. Multi-sensor-based forest monitoring approaches should, therefore, not simply combine optical and radar time series on a data level, as it bears the risk of introducing artefacts.","[Balling, Johannes; Verbesselt, Jan; De Sy, Veronique; Herold, Martin; Reiche, Johannes] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",,"Balling, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",Johannes.balling@wur.nl; jan.verbesselt@wur.nl; niki.desy@wur.nl; martin.herold@wur.nl; Johannes.Reiche@wur.nl,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2021.0,12.0,4,,,,,,456,10.3390/f12040456,,,,,,,,WOS:000643039400001,

Impervious surface areas are an important indicator of urban ecological environmental change, therefore quickly and accurately estimating impervious surface areas is essential to monitoring the urban dynamics of change and human activities and their effects on urban environmental quality. Currently, few methods that are applied in estimating urban impervious surfaces are capable of providing results quickly and accurately. Accordingly, this study proposes a new index, named the normalized difference impervious index (NDII), based on Landsat TM images, which uses the visible (red, green, and blue) and thermal bands. The index was used to extract the impervious surface areas of Nanjing city, Jiangsu Province, China, and we assume that the average value of five times strict supervised classification is the true value of impervious surfaces. A combination of red and thermal bands extracted the impervious surfaces with a producer's accuracy of 86.9%, a user's accuracy of 84.6%, an overall accuracy of 91.4%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.8. The accuracy is 87.7% validated by high-resolution images.

The uncertainties in the calculated aerosol radiative forcing (Delta F) and radiative forcing efficiency (Delta F-eff) at the bottom of the atmosphere were also assessed. The stations have been selected attempting to cover different aerosols influences and hence radiative properties: urban-industrial, biomass burning, mineral dust, background continental, maritime aerosols and free troposphere. The AERONET solar downward fluxes at surface agree with ground-based measurements in all situations, with a correlation higher than 99% whereas the relation of observed to modeled fluxes ranges from 0.98 to 1.02. Globally an overestimation of 9 +/- 12 Wm(-2) of solar measurements was found, whereas for MLO (clear atmosphere) the differences decrease noticeably up to 2 +/- 10 Wm(-2). The highest dispersion between AERONET estimates and measurements was observed in locations dominated by mineral dust and mixed aerosols types. In these locations, the F and Delta F uncertainties have shown a modest increase of the differences for high aerosol load, contrary to Delta F-eff which are strongly affected by low aerosol load. Overall the discrepancies clustered within 9 +/- 12 Wm(-2) for Delta F and 28 +/- 30 Wm(-2) per unit of aerosol optical depth, tau, at 0.55 mu m for Delta F-eff, where the latter is given for tau(0.44 mu m) >= 0.4.

This study focuses on a successional tropical forest under logging practices in East Kalimantan province, Indonesia. We modeled the forest attributes using both a parametric multiple linear regression analysis and neural networks approach, with Landsat ETM data acquired in 2000 (ETM00). We compiled sample plot data using forest inventory data collected from 1997 to 1998. A total of 226 plots were used to train the models and 112 plots were used for the validation. The remote sensing data (spectral values, vegetation indices, texture, etc.) coupled with digital elevation model (DEM) were experimented with and selectively used to model basal area, stem volume and above ground biomass (AGB). We investigated the possibility to estimate the forest attributes from bitemporal ETM data by calibrating radiometric properties of the ETM image from 2003 (ETM03) using the multivariate alteration detection method. The Pearson correlations showed that the mean texture index is strongly correlated with the forest attributes. We show that neural networks resulted in a higher coefficient of determination (r(2)) and lower RMSE than multiple regressions for predicting the forest attributes. The estimated forest properties increased with the forest succession advancement (i.e. from the open forest to advanced secondary forest classes). The modeled basal area, stem volume and AGB varied from 10.7-15.1 m(2) ha(-1), 123.2-181.9 m(3) ha(-1), and 132.7-185.3 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The RMSE, values of model fitting ranged from 11.2% to 13.3%, and the test dataset estimated slightly higher RMSE(r) which varied from 12% to 14.1%. The ETM03 forest attributes revealed favorable estimates, showing considerably higher estimates than the ETM00. The estimation of forest properties using neural networks makes Landsat data a valuable source of information for forest management, mainly with the recent free access to its historical dataset.

The process of andosolization, which may occur in ferrallitic soils with high organic matter content, can involve transformation from well crystallized Fe oxides to poorly crystallized Fe oxides and Fe-humus complexes. This study investigates such changes in pedogenic Fe mineral associations for a soil toposequence between 1500 and 2260 m altitude along the southern flank of the volcanic Bambouto Mountains, Western Cameroon. The soils consist of highly weathered material, dominated by kaolinite, gibbsite and Fe oxides, grading to Protoandic Umbrisols at high altitude, recording an increase in SOM content with increasing altitude. As revealed by selective extraction analysis, the relative amount of poorly crystalline Fe oxides is low in the Bt and Bo horizons of low-altitude pedons, as well as in deep subsurface horizons of the high-altitude pedons. In contrast, it is significantly higher in the A and Bw horizons of the high-altitude pedons, with a clear increase with increasing altitude. Mossbauer spectroscopy analysis of B horizon samples identifies goethite as the dominant Fe oxide phase in nearly all pedons, with higher hematite contents in a mid-altitude zone marked by lower annual rainfall than in other parts of the toposequence. The Mossbauer spectra also reveal the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM)-ferrihydrite, whose abundance is greatest in the Bw horizon of the high-altitude pedons, with an increase in relative abundance with increasing altitude. The observed patterns are attributed to dissolution-reprecipitation of Fe oxides that initially formed through ferrallitic weathering of volcanic parent materials that were roughly uniform along the toposequence. At high altitude, coupled hematite dissolution and DOM-ferrihydrite formation are favoured by high organic matter contents and low pH, related to cool humid environmental conditions and their effect on the vegetation and organic matter cycling.","[Van Ranst, E.; Ye, L.] Univ Ghent, Dept Geol WE13, Ghent, Belgium; [Mees, F.] Royal Museum Cent Africa, Dept Geol & Mineral, Tervuren, Belgium; [De Grave, E.] Univ Ghent, Dept Phys & Astron, Ghent, Belgium; [Cornelis, J-T.] Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, BIOSE Dept, Gembloux, Belgium; [Delvaux, B.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Soil Sci, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",,"Van Ranst, E (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Geol WE13, Ghent, Belgium.",eric.vanranst@ugent.be,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 1,2019.0,347.0,,,,,244,251,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.013,,,,,,,,WOS:000468715000024,

We identified two types of coffee plantations ('open-canopy' and 'close-canopy') along with natural forest/shrubland, mangrove, water bodies, sandy coastal soils, bare soil, urban areas and agriculture. Notwithstanding the small sample size of the accuracy data, our assessment revealed an overall accuracy of 76.7% (Kappa coefficient = 0.68), considering only the four classes with independent field data. The overall classification accuracy for distinguishing coffee plantations from non-mangrove natural forest was 81.6% and the classification accuracy for distinguishing 'open-canopy' from 'close-canopy' coffee plantations was 85.7%.

The result may be boom-bust cycles of development. If these phenomena are widespread across developing countries, then long-run expansion of agricultural land could be associated with lower levels of real income per capita, which may also fluctuate with prolonged expansion. A panel analysis conducted over 1961-2015 for 98 developing economies fails to reject this hypothesis.

Here, I propose five principles for understanding the disturbance dynamics of ants-a globally dominant faunal group that is widely used as bioindicators in land management, which appear to have wide applicability to other taxa. These principles are as follows: (1) The most important effects of habitat disturbance on ants are typically indirect, through its effects on habitat structure, microclimate, resource availability and competitive interactions; (2) habitat openness is a key driver of variation in ant communities; (3) ant species responses to disturbance are to a large degree determined by their responses to habitat openness; (4) the same disturbance will have different effects on ants in different habitats, because of different impacts on habitat openness; and (5) ant community responses to the same disturbance will vary according to ant functional composition and biogeographical history in relation to habitat openness. I illustrate these principles using results primarily from studies of ant responses to fire, a dominant agent of disturbance globally, to provide a common disturbance currency for comparative analysis. I argue that many of the principles also apply to other faunal groups and so can be considered as general ecological laws. As is the case for ants, many impacts of habitat disturbance on other faunal groups are fundamentally related to habitat openness, the effects of disturbance on it and the functional composition of species in relation to it.","[Andersen, Alan N.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia",,"Andersen, AN (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia.",alan.andersen@cdu.edu.au,,,,,,,66,67,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2019.0,88.0,3,,,,350,362,,10.1111/1365-2656.12907,,,,,,,,WOS:000460767200002,

Changing land-use strategies that would maintain standing forests may be among the least expensive of climate change mitigation options. Further, secondary tropical forests have been suggested to have great value for their potential to sequester atmospheric C. These options require an understanding of and capability to quantify C dynamics at landscape scales. Because of the diversity of physical and biotic features of tropical forests as well as approaches and intensities of land uses within the neotropics, there are tremendous differences in the capacity of different landscapes to store and sequester C. Major gaps in our current knowledge include quanti. cation of C pools, rates and patterns of biomass loss following land-cover change, and quanti. cation of the C storage potential of secondary forests following abandonment. In this paper we present a synthesis and further analyses from recent studies that describe C pools, patterns of C decline associated with land use, and rates of C accumulation following secondary-forest establishment-all information necessary for climate-change mitigation options. Ecosystem C pools of Neotropical primary forests minimally range from similar to 141 to 571 Mg/ha, demonstrating tremendous differences in the capacity of different forests to store C. Most of the losses in C and nutrient pools associated with conversion occur when. res are set to remove the slashed forest to prepare sites for crop or pasture establishment. Fires burning slashed primary forests have been found to result in C losses of 62-80% of prefire aboveground pools in dry (deciduous) forest landscapes and 29-57% in wet (evergreen) forest landscapes. Carbon emissions equivalent to the aboveground primary-forest pool arise from repeated. res occurring in the first 4 to 10 years following conversion. Feedbacks of climate change, land-cover change, and increasing habitat fragmentation may result in increases of both the area burned and the total quantity of biomass consumed per unit area by. re.

F mimics D very closely, and the Matheron index only behaves differently from F and D at the end of the data range. The deviation may be due to patch aggregation, which the Matheron index does not consider.

Several recent studies have demonstrated that rates of nitrogen mineralization are significantly different under plots with different plant composition and have correlated differences with plant traits such as C:N ratio or other measures of litter quality. However, these studies have not evaluated how rapidly changes in plant composition translate into changes in ecosystem N availability or cycling and the conditions under which individual species can change ecosystem nutrient fluxes. Exotic plant invasions offer an opportunity to evaluate how species effects develop as species move into communities where they have no prior history. We believe that they also offer an opportunity to explore how different and how abundant a species has to become to have a measurable impact on a key ecosystem process. In this chapter, we review the literature on the effects of nonnative plant invaders on nitrogen cycling with the goal of trying to identify when and where invaders should be expected to increase or decrease N cycling. We believe that the speed and magnitude of invader effects should vary as a function of how different invaders are from residents in particular traits, and how resistant the resident community and soils are to change. We also believe that the application of a variety of modeling approaches holds great promise in understanding interactions between invader traits and environmental conditions and that this application should be explored more completely. Because the database for this review is not large, we focus on identifying gaps in our knowledge that could be filled by carefully directed empirical work and quantitative modeling.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"D'Antonio, CM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,19,20,,,,,,,,,,,,2003.0,,,,,,363,384,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000221847700020,

The combined aboveground and soil carbon stock declined almost 36% after conversion from mature forest, however two additional cultivation cycles did not promote further significant decline, largely because of the stability of the soil carbon pool. Although age was the dominant factor in predicting total carbon stocks of secondary forests under shifting cultivation, the number of cultivation-fallow cycles should not be neglected. Understanding change beyond the first cycle of deforestation will enhance forest management at a local scale by improving predictions of secondary forest productivity and related agricultural productivity. A multi-cycle approach to deforestation is critical for regional and national evaluation of forest-based carbon sequestration. Finally, models of the global carbon cycle can be better constrained with more accurate quantification of carbon fluxes from land-use change. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The changes were quantified in all the three (rainy, winter and summer) seasons, in slope and depression microsites of the subsided land and an adjacent undamaged forest microsite. Physico-chemical characteristics were found to be altered after subsidence, showing a positive impact of subsidence on soil moisture, bulk density, water holding capacity, organic carbon content, total N and total P. The increase in all the parameters was found in depression microsites, while in slope microsites, the values were lower. Fine root biomass and root tips count increased in the subsided depression microsites, as demonstrated by increases of 62% and 45%, respectively. Soil nitrate-N and phosphate-P concentrations were also found to be higher in depression microsite, showing an increase of 35.68% and 24.74%, respectively. Depression microsite has also shown the higher MBN value with an increase over control. Net nitrification, net N-mineralization and MBN were increased in depression microsite by 29.77%, 25.72% and 34%, respectively.

We assessed the impacts of exotic, invasive grasses on ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling in the seasonal submontane woodlands of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where native grasses have been historically rare. Exotic grasses have become abundant over the past 30 yr and have altered two controls over N cycling: plant species composition and fire regime. Here we synthesize the results of a long-term investigation of species impacts in this system. To determine effects of grasses and fire on internal N cycling, we compared litterfall. decomposition, N mineralization from soil organic matter (SOM), and plant N uptake and production in invaded unburned forest. grass-removal plots within the forest, and woodland converted to grassland by fire. We measured ecosystem N loss via fire by comparing N pools among unburned, naturally burned, and experimentally burned sites. We also assessed the effects of fire on annual N fixation in the unburned forest vs. the grassland. Exotic grasses had relatively small effects on N cycling in the unburned woodland despite being abundant in the understory for 30 yr. Grasses contributed similar to 30% of fine litterfall and primary-production mass and N in the unburned woodland. However, these contributions did not result in significantly increased totals because litterfall and production of Metrosideros polymorpha, the dominant native tree, was reduced in the invaded woodland relative to grass-removal plots, presumably due to competition with grasses. Although area-weighted decomposition was lower in the grass-removal treatment than in the control, net N mineralization from litter and SOM were similar between these treatments. Annual plant N uptake was similar to annual net N mineralization from SOM in both treatments. By contrast. the burned grassland exhibited much lower rates of litterfall and production mass and N, but higher rates of net N mineralization from SOM than the woodland. As a result, total annual plant N uptake was only 17% of annual net mineralization. This change was primarily due to the loss of native species. Aboveground N pools were significantly reduced with fire. Native species were largely eliminated by fire. However, across all burned and unburned sites there was no change in total ecosystem N because the N contained in biomass was relatively small compared to N in litter and soil. Soil contained > 95% of ecosystem N in all sites. Only in the high-intensity experimental burn was there significant loss of N from the soil pool. Fire reduced N inputs through asymbiotic N fixation mainly due to the loss of M. polymorpha, whose litter is an important site of asymbiotic N fixation, and alteration of the soil O-layer. This reduction in N inputs makes it unlikely that fixation activity will replace N lost via combustion before the next fire. Fire and the ensuing loss of native species led to decreased N inputs, increased rates of N mineralization from litter and SOM. and dramatically reduced plant N uptake, potentially leading to a more leaky N cycle. It appears that the indirect effects of grasses on N cycling via the elimination of native species by fire is the most important pathway though which exotic grasses alter ecosystem N dynamics in this system.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Environm Organism & Populat Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Mack, MC (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",,,,,,,,137,150,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2001.0,11.0,5,,,,1323,1335,,10.2307/3060923,,,,,,,,WOS:000171417700007,

The study of ecological restoration in tropical forests has concentrated on identifying the barriers that limit recovery, with the aim of accelerating secondary succession. These barriers include: 1) lack of dispersal or propagules in the seed bank, 2) low germination rates, and 3) low rates of seedling recruitment due to the negative effects of diseases, predation and competition, or adverse physical conditions. Based on the analysis of literature from the last 20 years on ecological restoration in tropical forests, this work reviews the state of the art and perspectives in this area of research. The analysis indicated that 64% of the studies have been conducted in tropical rain forests, that 55% of them are mainly descriptive, and that, the experimental studies tend to evaluate only one or two limiting barriers, rather than concentrating on a long term integrative approach. Nevertheless, there is a promising future for restoration ecology; the experimental approach has grown exponentially and the social component is being included in the projects. Ecological restoration is consolidating itself as an integrative discipline, keeping in mind all the necessary aspects (ecological, social, economic) to achieve the recovery and conservation of the natural systems.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",,"Meli, P (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",pmeli@miranda.ecologia.unam.mx,,,,,,,34,45,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2003.0,28.0,10,,,,581,+,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000186289200004,

Techniques for physical fractionation of soil organic matter in conjunction with isotopic analyses (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) of those soil fractions have been used previously to (a) determine where organic C is stored relative to aggregate structure, (b) identify sources of SOC, (c) quantify turnover rates of SOC in specific soil fractions, and (d) evaluate organic matter quality. We used these two complementary approaches to characterize soil C storage and dynamics in the Rio Grande Plains of southern Texas where C(3) trees/shrubs (delta(13)C = -27 parts per thousand) have largely replaced C(4) grasslands (delta(13)C = -14 parts per thousand) over the past 100-200 years. Using a chronosequence approach, soils were collected from remnant grasslands (Time 0) and from woody plant stands ranging in age from 10 to 130 years. We separated soil organic matter into specific size/density fractions and determined their C and N concentrations and natural delta(13)C and delta(15)N values. Mean residence times (MRTs) of soil fractions were calculated based on changes in their delta(13)C with time after woody encroachment. The shortest MRTs (average = 30 years) were associated with all particulate organic matter (POM) fractions not protected within aggregates. Fine POM (53-250 mu m) within macro- and microaggregates was relatively more protected from decay, with an average MRT of 60 years. All silt + clay fractions had the longest MRTs (average = 360 years) regardless of whether they were found inside or outside of aggregate structure. delta(15)N values of soil physical fractions were positively correlated with MRTs of the same fractions, suggesting that higher delta(15)N values reflect an increased degree of humification. Increased soil C and N pools in wooded areas were due to both the retention of older C(4)-derived organic matter by protection within microaggregates and association with silt + clay, and the accumulation of new C(3)-derived organic matter in macroaggregates and POM fractions.

As the rate of land - use/land-cover change from forest to pasture or agriculture accelerates worldwide, it is becoming increasingly important to quantify the ecosystem biomass and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools of both intact forests and converted sites. In the central coastal region of Mexico, we sampled total aboveground biomass (TAGB), and the N and C pools of two floodplain forests, three upland dry forests, and four pastures converted from dry forest. We also sampled belowground biomass and soil C and N pools in two sites of each land-cover type. The TAGB of floodplain forests was as high as 416 Mg ha(-1), whereas the TAGB of the dry forest ranged from 94 to 126 Mg ha(-1). The TAGB of pastures derived from dry forest ranged from 20 to 34 Mg ha-1. Dead wood (standing and downed combined) comprised 27%-29% of the TABG of dry forest but only about 10% in floodplain forest. Root biomass averaged 32.0 Mg ha(-1) in floodplain forest, 17.1 Mg ha-1 in dry forest, and 5.8 Mg ha(-1) in pasture. Although total root biomass was similar between sites within land-cover types, root distribution varied by depth and by size class. The highest proportion of root biomass occurred in the top 20 cm of soil in all sites. Total aboveground and root C pools, respectively, were 12 and 2.2 Mg ha(-1) in pasture and reached 180 and 12.9 Mg ha(-1) in floodplain forest. Total aboveground and root pools, respectively, were 149 and 47 kg ha-1 in pasture and reached 2623 and 264 kg ha(-1) in floodplain forest. Soil organic C pools were greater in pastures than in dry forest, but soil N pools were similar when calculated for the same soil depths. Total ecosystem C pools were 306. The Mg ha(-1) in floodplain forest, 141 Mg ha(-1) in dry forest, and 124 Mg ha(-1) in pasture. Soil C comprised 37%-90% of the total ecosystem C, whereas soil N comprised 85%-98% of the total. The N pools lack of a consistent decrease in soil pools caused by land-use change suggests that C and N losses result from the burning of aboveground biomass. We estimate that in Mexico, dry forest landscapes store approximately 2.3 Pg C, which is about equal to the C stored by the evergreen forests of that country (approximately 2.4 Pg C). Potential C emissions to the atmosphere from the burning of biomass in the dry tropical landscapes of Mexico may amount to 708 Tg C, as compared with 569 Tg C from evergreen forests.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Recursos Nat, Morelia 58090, Michoacan, Mexico; Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA",,"Jaramillo, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Recursos Nat, AP 27-3 Xangari, Morelia 58090, Michoacan, Mexico.",luque@oikos.unam.mx,,,,,,,149,160,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2003.0,6.0,7,,,,609,629,,10.1007/s10021-002-0195-4,,,,,,,,WOS:000186779400001,

Emissions of trace gases and aerosols from open biomass burning are estimated from burned areas, fuel load maps, combustion factors, and emission factors. Burned area was quantified by using satellite data in conjunction with a fractional vegetation cover map. To account for spatial heterogeneity in the main types of vegetation within each 1-km grid cell, global fuel load maps have been developed from biomass density data sets for herbaceous and tree-covered land together with global fractional tree and vegetation cover maps. In regions with 40-60% tree cover a relationship between combustion completeness (or combustion factor) in fine fuels and tree cover based on recent field studies is implemented. In regions with <40% tree cover the combustion factor and emissions are related to global satellite-derived data for leaf area index. In regions with >60% tree cover and for coarse fuels in regions with 40-60% tree cover, average values for combustion factors and emission factors from field measurements are used. In addition to biomass burning from open vegetation fires, the emissions from biofuel burning in 2000 are estimated. Our best estimate for the global amount of burned biomass in 2000 is 5613 Tg DM yr(-1), of which 2814 Tg DM yr(-1) is associated with open burning and the remainder with biofuels. The total emissions are 2290 Tg C yr(-1) (as CO2), 496 Tg CO yr(-1), 32.2 Tg CH4 yr(-1), 38.0 Tg NHMC yr(-1), 11.5 Tg HCHO yr(-1), 9.2 Tg CH3OH yr(-1), 21.7 Tg CH3COOH yr(-1), and 38.3 Tg PM2.5 yr(-1). Our estimates for CO2, CO, and CH4 emissions from open biomass burning combined with estimates of those from biofuel burning are in the range of the estimates constrained by chemical transport models and measurements. Our use of spatially and temporally explicit data and these comparisons to global models support the conclusion that our source map offers improvements in the emission data sets for estimating the global effects of biomass burning.","Univ Michigan, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Ito, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, 2455 Hayward, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",penner@umich.edu,,,,,,,205,217,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 5,2004.0,109.0,D14,,,,,,D14S05,10.1029/2003JD004423,,,,,,,,WOS:000221953900002,

However, disturbance can shift limitation away from P and toward nitrogen (N) because of disproportionately large N losses associated with its mobility relative to P in ecosystems. This shift was illustrated by model analyses in which large disturbances including timber extraction and slash-burn were simulated in a P-limited tropical forest. Re-accumulation of ecosystem C during secondary forest growth was initially N-limited, but long term limitation reverted to P. Mechanisms controlling shifts between N and P limitation included: (1) N volatility during slash combustion produced ash that increased soil solution P more than N, (2) a wide N: P ratio in residual fuel and belowground necromass relative to soil organic matter (SOM) N: P produced a simultaneous P sink and N source during decomposition, (3) a supplemental ( to aerosol deposition) external N source via biological N fixation. Redistribution of N and P from low C: nutrient SOM to high C: nutrient vegetation was the most important factor contributing to the resilience of ecosystem C accumulation during secondary growth. Resilience was diminished when multiple harvest and re-growth cycles depleted SOM. Phosphorus losses in particular resulted in long-term reductions of C storage capacity because of slow re-supply rates via deposition and the absence of other external sources. Sensitivity analyses limiting the depth of microbially active SOM in soil profiles further illustrated the importance of elements stored in SOM to ecosystem resilience, pointing to a need for better knowledge on the functioning of deeply buried SOM.","Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,"Herbert, DA (corresponding author), Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",,,,,,,,30,87,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2003.0,65.0,1,,,,121,150,,10.1023/A:1026020210887,,,,,,,,WOS:000185795900007,

This is driven by an incomplete understanding of the factors controlling Hg distribution and transport in tropical ecosystems. The review of existing Hg research into ASGM indicated that hydrology exerts major control on the final sink of Hg in tropical rivers. Total Hg concentrations in river water increase during high discharge events due to increased erosion and Hg export from soils. Geochemical composition and grain-size distribution strongly control Hg concentrations and distribution in sediment and soils. This review highlights the absence of standardized protocols for investigating ASGM-related Hg pollution, and that the applied research methodologies are often unsuitable for adequately assessing the processes involved. We underline the need to consider an extensive suite of biogeochemical, physical and hydrological information when investigating the final sink and risks of ASGM-related Hg. Standardized and accurate research methodologies, applicable to the challenges presented by these tropical environments, would greatly ease not only data comparability and synthesis between studies, but also help to differentiate between anthropogenic and natural Hg.

We used these watersheds as a landscape-scale experiment to assess effects of degree of deforestation on within-watershed retention and hydrological export of atmospheric inputs of nutrients. Retention was estimated by comparing rainfall nutrient concentrations (volume-weighted to allow for evapotranspiration) to concentrations in freshwater reaches of receiving streams. Retention of rain-derived nutrients in these Panama watersheds averaged 77, 85, 80, and 62 % for nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic N, and phosphate, respectively. Retention of rain-derived inorganic nitrogen, however, depended on watershed cover: retention of nitrate and ammonium in pasture-dominated watersheds was 95 and 98 %, while fully forested watersheds retained 65 and 80 % of atmospheric nitrate and ammonium inputs. Watershed forest cover did not affect retention of dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphate. Exports from more forested watersheds yielded DIN/P near 16, while pasture-dominated watersheds exported N/P near 2. The differences in magnitude of exports and ratios suggest that deforestation in these Panamanian forests results in exports that affect growth of plants and algae in the receiving stream and estuarine ecosystems. Watershed retention of dissolved inorganic nitrogen calculated from wet plus dry atmospheric deposition varied from 90 % in pasture- to 65 % in forest-dominated watersheds, respectively. Discharges of DIN to receiving waters from the watersheds therefore rose from 10 % of atmospheric inputs for pasture-dominated watersheds, to about 35 % of atmospheric inputs for fully forested watersheds. These results from watersheds with no agriculture or urbanization, but different conversion of forest to pasture by burning, show significant, deforestation-dependent retention within tropical watersheds, but also ecologically significant, and deforestation-dependent, exports that are biologically significant because of the paucity of nutrients in receiving tropical stream and coastal waters.","[Valiela, Ivan; Barth-Jensen, Coralie; Bartholomew, Megan] Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Stone, Thomas] Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA; [Crusius, John] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, US Geol Survey, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Fox, Sophia] Cape Cod Natl Seashore, Natl Pk Serv, Wellfleet, MA 02667 USA",,"Valiela, I (corresponding author), Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",ivaliela@mbl.edu,,,,,,,16,16,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2013.0,115.0,1-3,,,,299,315,,10.1007/s10533-013-9836-2,,,,,,,,WOS:000325116700019,

To facilitate this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has developed a simple carbon accounting method to estimate SOC stocks and flows in response to changes in land use. This method proposes three tiers for SOC change estimation. The higher the tier the greater the accuracy of the estimates, but also the complexity and the need of information. We used the RothC model to derive SOC change factors in order to develop a Tier 2 (T2) method. We applied this T2 and Tier 1 (T1) methods to estimate SOC stocks and flows in five sub regions of the Argentinean Pampa Region between 1900 and 2006. We evaluated T1 and T2 methods performances comparing their estimates against empirical data, at sub region and county scales. At both spatial scales, T1 method showed a poor performance and an important improvement was achieved with T2 method, although its performance varied among spatial scales. At sub region scale, T2 method estimates were very good (R-2 = 0.85), but at county scale the fit was poor (R-2 = 0.46). However, this poor fit may have been due, at least in part, to the quality of the input and validation information of one of the sub regions (Flooding Pampa) since its exclusion of the analysis led to an increase of the R-2 up to 0.73. Tier 2 was used to estimate the impact of land use change on SOC. Sub regions with the highest estimated SOC losses were Central Pampa, Southern Pampa - Eastern and Rolling Pampa, with 35%, 28% and 26% average SOC losses, respectively. Given that several conceptual limitations of T1 method were overcome with our simple T2 method, we conclude that T2 method is more realistic to conduct a regional SOC inventory. Besides, our T2 method was developed without using empirical information from field or laboratory studies about SOC change and, therefore, countries that have not enough empirical information available on SOC change associated to land use could derive a similar T2 method.

The analysis of data containing a large proportion of mixed pixels may therefore benefit from the decomposition of the pixels into their component parts. Methods for unmixing the composition of pixels have been used in a range of studies and have often increased the accuracy of the analyses. However, many of the methods assume linear mixing and require end-member spectra, but mixing is often non-linear and end-member spectra are difficult to obtain. In this paper, an alternative approach to unmixing the composition of image pixels, which makes no assumptions about the nature of the mixing and does not require end-member spectra, is presented. The method is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and shown in a case study to provide accurate estimates of sub-pixel land cover composition. The results of this case study showed that accurate estimates of the proportional cover of a class and its areal extent may be made. It was also shown that there was a tendency for the accuracy of the unmixing to increase with the complexity of the network and the intensity of training. The results indicate the potential to derive accurate information from remotely sensed data sets dominated by mixed pixels.","UNIV SOUTHAMPTON, DEPT GEOG, SOUTHAMPTON SO17 1BJ, HANTS, ENGLAND; UNIV WALES SWANSEA, DEPT GEOG, SWANSEA SA2 8PP, W GLAM, WALES",,"Foody, GM (corresponding author), UNIV SALFORD, DEPT GEOG, TELFORD INST ENVIRONM SYST, SALFORD M5 4WT, LANCS, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,,127,133,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 10,1997.0,18.0,4,,,,937,953,,10.1080/014311697218845,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997WL47200016,

This uncertainty is, in part, due to unknown levels of future agricultural intensification and international trade. Using an economic land-use model, we assessed potential future losses of natural vegetation with a focus on how these may threaten biodiversity hotspots and intact forest landscapes. We analysed agricultural expansion under proactive and reactive biodiversity protection scenarios, and for different rates of pasture intensification. We found growing food demand to lead to a significant expansion of cropland at the expense of pastures and natural vegetation. In our reference scenario, global cropland area increased by more than 400Mha between 2015 and 2050, mostly in Africa and Latin America. Grazing intensification was a main determinant of future land-use change. In Africa, higher rates of pasture intensification resulted in smaller losses of natural vegetation, and reduced pressure on biodiversity hotspots and intact forest landscapes. Investments into raising pasture productivity in conjunction with proactive land-use planning appear essential in Africa to reduce further losses of areas with high conservation value. In Latin America, in contrast, higher pasture productivity resulted in increased livestock exports, highlighting that unchecked trade can reduce the land savings of pasture intensification. Reactive protection of sensitive areas significantly reduced the conversion of natural ecosystems in Latin America. We conclude that protection strategies need to adapt to region-specific trade positions. In regions with a high involvement in international trade, area-based conservation measures should be preferred over strategies aimed at increasing pasture productivity, which by themselves might not be sufficient to protect biodiversity effectively.","[Kreidenweis, Ulrich; Humpenoeder, Florian; Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon; Popp, Alexander] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Domain Sustainable Solut, Potsdam, Germany; [Kreidenweis, Ulrich] Leibniz Inst Agr Engn & Bioecon ATB, Dept Technol Assessment & Subst Cycles, Potsdam, Germany; [Kreidenweis, Ulrich] Tech Univ Berlin, Sch Planning Bldg Environm 6, Berlin, Germany; [Kehoe, Laura] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Kehoe, Laura] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Kehoe, Laura; Kuemmerle, Tobias] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Kuemmerle, Tobias; Lotze-Campen, Hermann] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Berlin, Germany; [Lotze-Campen, Hermann] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Domain Climate Impacts & Vulnerabil, Potsdam, Germany; [Lotze-Campen, Hermann] Humboldt Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Berlin, Germany",,"Kreidenweis, U (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Agr Engn & Bioecon, Potsdam, Germany.",ukreidenweis@atb-potsdam.de,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2018.0,24.0,7,,,,3199,3213,,10.1111/gcb.14272,,,,,,,,WOS:000437281500037,

A non linear relation was observed between whole blood Se and plasma Se levels, with plasma Se concentrations leveling off at approximately 200 mu g L-1, whereas 16% and 3% of individuals exhibited whole blood concentrations higher than 500 mu g L-1 and 1000 mu g L-1, respectively. In contrast, a linear relationship was previously reported in communities consuming Brazil nuts which are rich Se, mainly present as selenomethionine. This suggests that a different selenocompound, possibly selenoneine, is present in the Arctic marine food chain and accumulates in the blood cellular fraction of Inuit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding functional traits of species that colonize at different points in succession can provide insight into community assembly. Although studies on functional traits during forest succession have focused on trees, lianas (woody vines) also contribute strongly to forest biomass, species richness, and dynamics. We examined life history traits of lianas in a forest chronosequence in Costa Rica to determine which traits vary consistently over succession. We conducted 0.1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites. To examine the establishment of young individuals, we only included small lianas (0.51.5 cm diameter at 1.3 m height). For each species, we identified seed size, dispersal mode, climbing mode, and whether or not the seedling is self-supporting. We found a strong axis of variation determined by seed size and seedling growth habit, with early successional communities dominated by small-seeded species with abiotic dispersal and climbing seedlings, while large-seeded, animal-dispersed species with free-standing seedlings increased in abundance with stand age. Contrary to previous research and theory, we found a decrease in the abundance of stem twiners and no decrease in the abundance of tendril-climbers during succession. Seed size appears to be a better indicator of liana successional stage than climbing mode. Liana life history traits change predictably over succession, particularly traits related to seedling establishment. Identifying whether these trait differences persist into the growth strategies of mature lianas is an important research goal, with potential ramifications for understanding the impact of lianas during tropical forest succession.","[Letcher, Susan G.] SUNY Coll Purchase, Sch Nat & Social Sci, Dept Environm Studies, Purchase, NY 10577 USA; [Letcher, Susan G.] Org Trop Studies, San Pedro Montes De Oca 11501, Costa Rica; [Chazdon, Robin L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",,"Letcher, SG (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Purchase, Sch Nat & Social Sci, Dept Environm Studies, Purchase, NY 10577 USA.",susan.letcher@purchase.edu,,,,,,,21,21,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2012.0,44.0,6,,,,720,727,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2012.00865.x,,,,,,,,WOS:000310729200002,

Data on human body weight and relative leg length support these rules; however, it is unknown whether such associations are attributable to lean tissue (the heat-producing component) or fat (energy stores). Data on weight, height, and two skinfold thickness were obtained from the literature for 137 nonindustrialized populations, providing 145 male and 115 female individual samples. A variety of indices of adiposity and lean mass were analyzed. Preliminary analyses indicated secular increases in skinfolds in men but not women, and associations of age and height with lean mass in both sexes. Decreasing annual temperature was associated with increasing body mass index (BMI), and increasing triceps but not subscapular skinfold. After adjusting for skinfolds, decreasing temperature remained associated with increasing BMI. These results indicate that colder environments favor both greater peripheral energy stores, and greater lean mass. Contrasting results for triceps and subscapular skinfolds might be due to adaptive strategies either constraining central adiposity in cold environments to reduce cardiovascular risk, or favoring central adiposity in warmer environments to maintain energetic support of the immune system. Polynesian populations were analyzed separately and contradicted all of the climate trends, indicating support for the hypothesis that they are cold-adapted despite occupying a tropical region. It is unclear whether such associations emerge through natural selection or through trans-generational and life-course plasticity.

Although an indispensable and important requirement for decision makers, coherent and accurate estimates of grassland and forest AGB especially in complex environments are still lacking. In this study, we aim to assess the capability of two strategies to map grassland and forest AGB in a complex alpine ecosystem, i.e., using a discrete as well as a continuous field (CF) mapping approach based on imaging spectroscopy (IS) data. In situ measurements of grassland and forest AGB were acquired in the Swiss National Park (SNP) to calibrate empirical models and to validate AGB retrievals. The selection of robust empirical models considered all potential two narrow-band combinations of the simple ratio (SR) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) generated from Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) IS data and in situ measurements. We found a narrow-band SR including spectral bands from the short-wave infrared (SWIR) (1689 nm) and near infrared (NIR) (851 nm) as the best regression model to estimate grassland AGB. Forest AGB showed highest correlation with an SR generated from two spectral bands in the SWIR (1498, 2112 nm). The applied accuracy assessment revealed good results for estimated grassland AGB using the discrete mapping approach [R-2 of 0.65, mean RMSE (mRMSE) of 0.91 t.ha(-1), and mean relative RMSE (mrRMSE) of 26%]. The CF mapping approach produced a higher R-2 (R-2 = 0.94), and decreased the mRMSE and the mrRMSE to 0.55 t.ha(-1) and 15%, respectively. For forest, the discrete approach predicted AGB with an R-2 value of 0.64, an mRMSE of 67.8 t.ha(-1), and an mrRMSE of 25%. The CF mapping approach improved the accuracy of forest AGB estimation with R-2 = 0.85, mean RMSE = 55.85 t.ha(-1), and mean relative RMSE = 21%. Our results indicate that, in general, both mapping approaches are capable of accurately mapping grassland and forest AGB in complex environments using IS data, whereas the CF-based approach yielded higher accuracies due to its capability to incorporate subpixel information (abundances) of different land cover types.","[Fatehi, Parviz; Damm, Alexander; Schaepman, Michael E.; Kneuebuhler, Mathias] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schweiger, Anna-Katharina] Res Dept, CH-7530 Zernez, Switzerland",,"Fatehi, P (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",parviz.fatehi@geo.uzh.ch; alexander.damm@geo.uzh.ch; anna.schweiger@nationalpark.ch; michael.schaepman@geo.uzh.ch; mathias.kneubuehler@geo.uzh.ch,,,,,,,6,7,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2015.0,8.0,6,,,,3123,3139,,10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2432075,,,,,,,,WOS:000359264000069,

They are today threatened by deforestation but also by forest degradation, which is more difficult to study. Here, we performed a systematic review of studies on moist tropical forest degradation using remote sensing and fitting indicators of forest resilience to perturbations. Geographical repartition, spatial extent and temporal evolution were analyzed. Indicators of compositional, structural and regeneration criteria were noted as well as remote sensing indices and metrics used. Tropical moist forest degradation is not extensively studied especially in the Congo basin and in southeast Asia. Forest structure (i.e., canopy gaps, fragmentation and biomass) is the most widely and easily measured criteria with remote sensing, while composition and regeneration are more difficult to characterize. Mixing LiDAR/Radar and optical data shows good potential as well as very high-resolution satellite data.

As a consequence, studies often use a qualitative approach and contrast different land-use categories, or use structural ecosystem attributes as a proxy for land-use intensity. In this paper we compared these different approaches with two quantitative approaches using forest management as an example. We carried out detailed biodiversity assessments of ten different groups of organisms, ranging from fungi and plants to arthropods and birds; in 12 different forest stands of four forest types in three regions of Southern Germany. We compared the explanatory power of the categorical approach to the explanatory power of (1) stand structural attributes, (2) stand structural complexity indices, (3) measures of forest 'naturalness', and (4) a recently developed quantitative descriptors of land-use intensity in forests, Silvicultural Management Intensity (SMI). The diversities of many taxa differed between the different land-use categories but the explanatory power of the categorical approach strongly decreased when using jackknifing. Single structural attributes explained differences in biodiversity for some taxa which were illustrative for proximate mechanisms underlying biodiversity changes. Stand structural complexity indices i.e., combinations of single structural attributes, showed higher explanatory power than single structural attributes but explained less variation in biodiversity among stands than land-use intensity measures. SMI was negatively correlated with forest 'naturalness', and, for many groups of organisms, increasing SMI decreased biodiversity, but trophic guilds responded differently. Some guilds, such as wood- and bark living fungi, saprophytic arthropods, herbivores, canopy predators and breeding birds showed a clear negative response to increasing land-use intensity, while for others such as plants there was no relationship. Some guilds, such as mosses and ground dwelling predators appeared to even benefit from increased land-use intensity. Using a quantitative measure of land-use intensity can thus help to understand even more subtle relationships between human impact and the diversity of organisms. Measures such as SMI seem to be useful tools for quantifying land-use intensity in forests and may be applied to biodiversity data of different forest ecosystems worldwide.","[Gossner, Martin M.; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Schall, Peter; Ammer, Christian] Univ Gottingen, Fac Forest Sci, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Ammer, Ulrich; Engel, Kerstin; Schubert, Holger; Simon, Ulrich; Utschick, Hans] Tech Univ Munich, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",,"Gossner, MM (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",martin.gossner@tum.de,,,,,,,33,34,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2014.0,5.0,9,,,,,,113,10.1890/ES14-00177.1,,,,,,,,WOS:000345097000010,

We examined emissions of N(2)O and NO and their relationships to land use and forest composition, litterfall, soil nitrogen (N) pools and turnover, soil moisture, and patterns of carbon (C) cycling in a lower montane, subtropical wet region of Puerto Rico. Fluxes of N(2)O and NO were measured monthly for over 1 year in old (more than 60 years old) pastures, early- and mid-successional forests previously in pasture, and late-successional forests not known to have been in pasture within the tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa) forest zone. Additional, though less frequent, measures were also made in an experimentally fertilized tabonuco forest. N(2)O fluxes exceeded NO fluxes at all sites, reflecting the consistently wet environment. The fertilized forest had the highest N oxide emissions (22.0 kg . N . ha(-1) . y(-1)). Among the unfertilized sites, the expected pattern of increasing emissions with stand age did not occur in all cases. The mid-successional forest most dominated by leguminous trees had the highest emissions (9.0 kg N . ha(-1) . y(-1)), whereas the mid-successional forest lacking legumes had the lowest emissions (0.09 kg N . ha(-1) . y(-1)). N oxide fluxes from late-successional forests were higher than fluxes from pastures. Annual N oxide fluxes correlated positively to leaf litter N, net nitrification potential nitrification, soil nitrate, and net N mineralization and negatively to leaf litter C:N ratio. Soil ammonium was not related to N oxide emissions. Forests with lower fluxes of N oxides had higher rates of C mineralization than sites with higher N oxide emissions. We conclude that (a) N oxide fluxes were substantial where the availability of inorganic N exceeded the requirements of competing biota; (b) species composition resulting from historical land use or varying successional dynamics played an important role in determining N availability; and (c) the established ecosystem models that predict N oxide loss from positive relationships with soil ammonium may need to be modified.","USDA, Forest Serv, Int Inst Trop Forestry, Rio Piedras, PR 00928 USA; Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,"Erickson, H (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana, Dept Sci & Technol, POB 21150, San Juan, PR 00928 USA.",um_herickson@suagm.edu,,,,,,,122,128,,,,,,,,,,,JAN-FEB,2001.0,4.0,1,,,,67,84,,10.1007/s100210000060,,,,,,,,WOS:000167550100006,

Health status of the animals was evaluated by direct physical examination and by hematological, biochemical, virological, and parasitological surveys of collected blood. The physical condition of the howlers was slightly worse toward the end of the capture period, but that of sakis and tamarins remained satisfactory. Several ectoparasites (ticks, larvae of dipterous insects, fleas, and lice) were collected, and various wounds, apparently nondebilitating, were recorded in howlers. Hematological and biochemical profiles determined for the three species revealed a slight anemia in howlers. Entamoeba, Strongyloides, and Trypanoxyurus were common in fecal samples of howlers. A survey of blood smears from the three species revealed infection by several types of microfilaria, Trypanosoma rangeli-like and Plasmodium brasilianum in all three, and Trypanosoma cruzi-like in howlers. These infections had no significant impact on the health status or the hematological profiles. Serologic investigations revealed occasional reactions against Toxoplasma gondii, a strong anti-Plasmodium response in the two Cebidae species, and a weaker one in tamarins. Attempts to isolate arbovirus failed, but antibody responses to Mayaro and yellow fever viruses were strong, especially in the howlers. A strong correlation between age and serological status led to a better understanding of the epidemic cycles.

We estimated long-term, present-day and future exposure to wildfire-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across Alaska for the general population and subpopulations to assess vulnerability using observed data for the present day (1997-2010), modelled estimates for the present day (1997-2001), and modelled estimates for the future (2047-2051). First, we assessed wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure by estimating monthly-average wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels across 1997-2010 for 158 Alaskan census tracts, using atmospheric transport modelling based on observed area-burned data. Second, we estimated changes in future (2047-2051) wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure compared to the present-day (1997-2001) by estimating the monthly-average wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels for 29 boroughs/census areas (county-equivalent areas), under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B scenario from an ensemble of 13 climate models. Subpopulation risks for present and future exposure levels were estimated by summing area-weighted exposure levels utilizing the 2000 Census and State of Alaska's population projections. We assessed vulnerability by several subpopulation characteristics (e.g. race/ethnicity, urbanicity). Wildfire-PM(2.5)exposure levels during 1997-2010 were highest in interior Alaska during July. Among subpopulations, average summer (June-August) exposure levels for urban dwellers and African-American/Blacks were highest at 9.1 mu g m(-3)and 10 mu g m(-3), respectively. Estimated wildfire-PM(2.5)varied by Native American tribe, ranging from average summer levels of 2.4 mu g m(-3)to 13 mu g m(-3)for Tlingit-Haida and Alaskan Athabascan tribes, respectively. Estimates indicate that by the mid-21st century, under climate change, almost all of Alaska could be exposed to increases of 100% or more in levels of wildfire-specific PM(2.5)levels. Exposure to wildfire-PM(2.5)likely presents a substantial public health burden in the present day for Alaska communities, with different impacts by subpopulation.

Yet, the two types of programs have been examined in distinct bodies of literature without much reference to each other. By systematically reviewing peer reviewed journal articles, dissertations, and select working papers, we suggest important similarities and differences between HCD cash transfer and PES programs that have been overlooked, particularly in how direct transfers are conceptualized and operationalized and how intended and unintended program outcomes are produced. Rather than considering HCD cash transfers and PES as two distinct tools, a common framework that conceptualizes direct transfers as an umbrella mechanism to produce socially desirable outcomes can contribute to effectively engaging target populations, addressing the needs of beneficiaries in a holistic way, comprehensively evaluating program impacts, and enabling opportunities to build synergies and minimize redundancies and competition across programs. We conclude by offering five insights into future research, program development, and policy innovations. Specifically, PES programs can learn from HCD cash transfer programs to (1) incorporate considerations of economic and gender inequalities to better sustain long-term environmental outcomes; (2) enhance collaboration among PES scholars, program practitioners, and policy makers to improve PES design and implementation and minimize adverse unintended impacts; (3) use randomized control trials to measure the causal impacts of PES; and (4) reconsider the role of conditionality to promote simultaneous production of environmental, economic, and social benefits. HCD cash transfer programs can learn from PES programs to (5) explore collaborative, community-based program design and implementation to facilitate not only adoption of socially desirable behaviors but also long-term human capital gains.

This health-sciences-inspired framework can be applied to determine probable causes of LUC in the context of bioenergy. Calculations of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for LUC associated with biofuel production are critical in determining whether a fuel qualifies as a biofuel or advanced biofuel category under regional (EU), national (US, UK), and state (California) regulations. Biofuel policymakers and scientists continue to discuss to what extent presumed indirect land-use change (ILUC) estimates should be included in GHG accounting for biofuel pathways. Current estimates of ILUC for bioenergy rely largely on economic simulation models that focus on causal pathways involving global commodity trade and use coarse land-cover data with simple land classification systems. This paper challenges the application of such models to estimate global areas of LUC in the absence of causal analysis. The proposed causal analysis framework begins with a definition of the change that has occurred and proceeds to a strength-of-evidence approach that includes plausibility of relationship, completeness of causal pathway, spatial co-occurrence, time order, analogous agents, simulation model results, and quantitative agent-response relationships. We discuss how LUC may be allocated among probable causes for policy purposes and how the application of the framework has the potential to increase the validity of LUC models and resolve controversies about ILUC, such as deforestation, and biofuels.

The multi-scale moving t-test was applied to determine rainy season and K-means cluster analysis was used to divide China into sub-regions to better investigate rainy season features. The possible linkage of changing characteristics of onset and retreat to climate factors were also explored. Results show that: (1) the onset started from middle March in the southeast of China to early June in the northwest and rainy season ended earliest in the northwest and southeast while the central China had the latest retreat; (2) Delayed onset and advanced retreat over time were observed in many parts of China, together with overall stable or increased rainy-season precipitation, would likely lead to higher probability of flooding; (3) The onset (retreat) was associated with the increased (decreased) number of cyclones in eastern China and anticyclone near the South China Sea. Delayed onset, and advanced retreat were likely related to cold and warm sea surface temperature (SST) in the conventional El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) regions, respectively.

In this study, Se levels in water, cropland soils and various crops from high-Se areas of Enshi were measured to investigate the distribution and bioavailability of Se in the environments, as well as probable daily intake (PDI) of Se for local residents. The total Se in surface water ranged from 2.0 to 519.3 mu g/L with a geometric mean of 46.0 +/- 127.8 mu g/L (n = 48), 70.5-99.5% of which was present in the form of Se(VI). The soil Se concentration varied from 2.89 to 873 mu/g with a geometric mean of 936 +/- 18.6 mu g/g (n = 45), and most of Se was associated with organic matter (OM-Se): The total Se in rice, corn, and vegetable samples were 2.11 +/- 2.87 mu g/g (n = 21), 3.76 +/- 11.6 mu g/g (n = 16), and 2.09 +/- 3.38 mu g/g (n = 25), respectively. Stream water Se is likely leached from carbonaceous shale and mine wastes, leading to Se accumulation in paddy soils. OM-Se may play an important role in Se uptake by rice plant in high-Se area of Enshi. The PDI of Se is approximately 2144 mu g/day, and Se concentration in blood is estimated at about 3248 mu g/L, posing a potential chronic Se poisoning risk to local residents. Cereal consumption (48.5%) makes a great contribution to human daily Se intake, followed by vegetables (36.6%), meats (8.5%), and drinking water (6.4%). However, when assessing health risk on human in high-Se areas, the contribution of drinking water to daily Se intake cannot be ignored due to high Se content and dominant Se(VI) species. Local inhabitants should be advised not to grow crops in high-Se lands or irrigate using high-Se water. If possible, they should drink pipe water and consume foods mixed with those from outside the high-Se areas. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we show that contemporary global patterns in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) emissions drive large hemispheric variation in precipitation chemistry. These global patterns of nutrient emission and deposition (N:P) are in turn closely reflected in the water chemistry of naturally oligotrophic lakes (r(2)=0.81, p<0.0001). Observed increases in anthropogenic N deposition play a role in nutrient concentrations (r(2)=0.20, p<0.05); however, atmospheric deposition of P appears to be major contributor to this pattern (r(2)=0.65, p<0.0001). Atmospheric simulations indicate a global increase in P deposition by 1.4 times the preindustrial rate largely due to increased dust and biomass burning emissions. Although changes in the mass flux of global P deposition are smaller than for N, the impacts on primary productivity may be greater because, on average, one unit of increased P deposition has 16 times the influence of one unit of N deposition. These stoichiometric considerations, combined with the evidence presented here, suggest that increases in P deposition may be a major driver of alpine Lake trophic status, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. These results underscore the need for the broader scientific community to consider the impact of atmospheric phosphorus deposition on the water quality of naturally oligotrophic lakes.","[Brahney, Janice; Neff, Jason C.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Mahowald, Natalie; Ward, Daniel S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Ballantyne, Ashley P.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",,"Brahney, J (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Janice.Brahney@ubc.ca,,,,,,,78,80,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2015.0,29.0,9,,,,1369,1383,,10.1002/2015GB005137,,,,,,,,WOS:000363703800003,

Here, we investigated the dynamics, phenotype, and function of Breg cells using Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS-infected C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were more susceptible to infection and had a stronger IL-10 response in spleen than C57BL/6 mice. Analysis of the surface markers of IL-10-producing cells with flow cytometry showed that CD19(+) B cells were one of the primary IL-10-producing populations in P. c. chabaudi AS-infected C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, especially in the latter one. The Breg cells had a heterogeneous phenotype which shifted during infection. The well-established Breg subset, CD19(+) CD5(+) CD1d(hi) cells, accounted for less than 20% of IL-10-producing B cells in both strains during the course of infection. Most Breg cells were IgG(+) and CD138(-) from day 0 to day 8 postinfection. Adoptive transfer of Breg cells to C57BL/6 mice infected with P. c. chabaudi AS led to a transient increase of parasitemia without an impact on survival rate. Our finding reveals that B cells play an active and important regulatory role in addition to mediating humoral immunity in immune response against malaria, which should be paid more attention in developing therapeutic or vaccine strategies against malaria involving stimulation of B cells.","[Han, Xue; Yang, Ji; Zhang, Yitong; Cao, Hongtao; Cao, Yaming; Qi, Zanmei] China Med Univ, Coll Basic Med Sci, Dept Immunol, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ji] Gen Hosp Shenyang Mil Area Command, Dept Expt Med, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yalin] Yichang Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lab Pathogen Microorganisms, Yichang, Peoples R China",,"Qi, ZM (corresponding author), China Med Univ, Coll Basic Med Sci, Dept Immunol, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",zmqi@cmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2018.0,86.0,5,,,,,,e00016-18,10.1128/IAI.00016-18,,,,,,,,WOS:000430637300008,

Land-use change has an impact on downstream aquatic processes, but those impacts have mainly been studied in temperate climate regions. The present article reviews the impacts of various tropical land-use changes caused by human activities on downstream riverine and estuarine water properties and biogeochemical cycles, focusing especially on the behaviors of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Logging of tropical primary forests, subsequent establishment of pasture lands, and occasional wildfire or intentional burning have decreased terrestrial N fixation and increased the discharge of P combined with soils, which has lowered the N:P ratio of dissolved inorganic nutrients in the adjacent stream waters and downstream rivers. Agricultural fertilizers and aquacultural practices basically cause nutrient enrichment in downstream riverine and estuarine waters, changing the N:P ratio depending on the source. Finally, urbanization causes eutrophication in many tropical estuaries, where a halocline forms easily because of a warm temperature throughout the year and the water at the bottom of the estuary tends to become hypoxic or anoxic. Overall, the impact of land-use change on aquatic processes may be more serious in tropical regions than in temperate or cold climate regions because of (1) a higher biomass and nutrient stock in original tropical forests; (2) higher precipitation, more frequent episodic flooding, and warmer temperatures in tropical regions; and (3) certain practices that are rapidly expanding in tropical regions such as land-based aquaculture. Various land-use changes are causing downstream nutrient enrichment or disturbance of the nutrient balance at tropical land-sea interfaces, and the overall N:P ratios in the aquatic ecosystem seem to be declining. Nonetheless, if proper management is conducted and the discharge of nutrients and soils ceases, tropical aquatic systems may have the potential to recover faster than those in other climate regions because of their abundant precipitation and warm temperature. Long-term monitoring and more attention to elemental stoichiometry are important areas for future research.","[Tanaka, Yasuaki; Minggat, Elizerberth; Roseli, Wardina] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Fac Sci, Environm & Life Sci, Jalan Tungku Link, BE-1410 Gadong, Brunei",,"Tanaka, Y (corresponding author), Univ Brunei Darussalam, Fac Sci, Environm & Life Sci, Jalan Tungku Link, BE-1410 Gadong, Brunei.",yasuaki.tanaka@ubd.edu.bn,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 9,2021.0,10.0,1,,,,,,40,10.1186/s13717-021-00315-3,,,,,,,,WOS:000662917100001,

Accurate representation of land surface parameters in land surface models (LSMs) is essential to accurately predict these LULCC-induced climate signals. In this work, we test the applicability of the default Noah, Noah-MB and Community Land Model (CLM) LSMs in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over Sub-Saharan Africa. We find that the default WRF LSMs do not accurately represent surface albedo, leaf area index, and surface roughness in this region due to various flawed assumptions, including the treatment of the MODIS woody savanna land use and land cover (LULC) category as closed shrubland. Consequently, we developed a WRF CLM version with more accurate African land surface parameters (CLM-AF), designed such that it can be used to evaluate the influence of LULCC. We evaluate meteorological performance for the default LSMs and CLM-AF against observational datasets, gridded products, and satellite estimates. Further, we conduct LULCC experiments with each LSM to determine if differences in land surface parameters impact the LULCC-induced climate responses. Despite clear deficiencies in surface parameters, all LSMs reasonably capture the spatial pattern and magnitude of near-surface temperature and precipitation. However, in the LULCC experiments, inaccuracies in the default LSMs result in illogical localized temperature and precipitation changes. Differences in thermal changes between Noah-MP and CLM-AF indicate that the temper- ature impacts from LULCC are dependent on the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to LULCC in Sub-Saharan Africa. Errors in land surface parameters indicate that the default WRF LSMs considered are not suitable for LULCC experiments in tropical or Southern Hemisphere regions and that proficient meteorological model performance can mask these issues. We find CLM-AF to be suitable for use in Sub-Saharan Africa LULCC studies, but more work is needed by the WRF community to improve its applicability to other tropical and Southern Hemisphere climates.","[Glotfelty, Timothy; West, J.

To address the question of how reforestation affects livelihoods and how they in turn affect reforestation, a meta-synthesis was undertaken of 339 scientific publications identified from a systematic literature search. This study is focused on smallholders in the humid tropics, and uses the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, which was developed by the UK Department for International Development as the framework for analysis. The links between reforestation and livelihoods are found to be diverse and highly interconnected. Reforestation is only one of a smallholder's activities and typically forms part of a mosaic of land uses across a landscape. Therefore, reforestation should be designed, managed and evaluated under the perspective of a diverse livelihood portfolio, and not as a single activity isolated from other portfolio components, especially under current landscape approaches. It is important for reforestation to be a complementary rather than a competitive livelihood activity. Reforestation has great potential to address poverty, and to increase smallholder socio-ecological resilience and local social equity. However, reforestation outcomes are often suboptimal. Assessing smallholder capacity and the surrounding environment prior to reforestation, and addressing limiting local capacities and conditions in a timely manner, may enhance the likelihood of optimal benefits.","[Ota, Liz; Herbohn, John; Gregorio, Nestor] Univ Sunshine Coast, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Herbohn, John; Harrison, Steve] Univ Queensland, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",,"Ota, L (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia.",lota@usc.edu.au,,,,,,,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2020.0,92.0,,,,,,,104455,10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104455,,,,,,,,WOS:000517662900015,

Historically, lowland forests have been converted into rubber forests, but more recently, the dominant conversion is into oil palm plantations. While it is expected that the large-scale conversion has strong effects on the carbon cycle, detailed studies quantifying carbon pools and total net primary production (NPPtotal) in above- and belowground tree biomass in land-use systems replacing rainforest (incl. oil palm plantations) are rare so far. We measured above- and belowground carbon pools in tree biomass together with NPPtotal in natural old-growth forests, jungle rubber' agroforests under natural tree cover, and rubber and oil palm monocultures in Sumatra. In total, 32 stands (eight plot replicates per land-use system) were studied in two different regions. Total tree biomass in the natural forest (mean: 384Mgha(-1)) was more than two times higher than in jungle rubber stands (147Mgha(-1)) and >four times higher than in monoculture rubber and oil palm plantations (78 and 50Mgha(-1)). NPPtotal was higher in the natural forest (24Mgha(-1)yr(-1)) than in the rubber systems (20 and 15Mgha(-1)yr(-1)), but was highest in the oil palm system (33Mgha(-1)yr(-1)) due to very high fruit production (15-20Mgha(-1)yr(-1)). NPPtotal was dominated in all systems by aboveground production, but belowground productivity was significantly higher in the natural forest and jungle rubber than in plantations. We conclude that conversion of natural lowland forest into different agricultural systems leads to a strong reduction not only in the biomass carbon pool (up to 166MgCha(-1)) but also in carbon sequestration as carbon residence time (i.e. biomass-C:NPP-C) was 3-10 times higher in the natural forest than in rubber and oil palm plantations.","[Kotowska, Martyna M.; Leuschner, Christoph; Hertel, Dietrich] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Triadiati, Triadiati; Meriem, Selis] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Biol, Bogor 16680, Indonesia",,"Kotowska, MM (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",mkotows@gwdg.de,,,,,,,110,111,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2015.0,21.0,10,,,,3620,3634,,10.1111/gcb.12979,,,,,,,,WOS:000360994500006,

During the dry season period, Sun photometer measurements indicate a rather turbid atmosphere with a mean aerosol optical depth for the overall period of 0.78 +/- 0.24 (at 440 nm). The aerosol absorption coefficient estimated at the surface ranged between 2.3 and 37.3 Mm(-1) (mean value 15.2 +/- 10.6 Mm(-1) at 520 nm) and the scattering coefficient between 44.5 and 232.3 Mm(-1) (mean 145 +/- 59 Mm(-1) at 520 nm). This leads to a single scattering albedo of between 0.81 and 0.98 (at 520 nm) with a mean (and standard deviation) value of 0.91 +/- 0.05, indicating moderately absorbing aerosols. In parallel, micropulse lidar measurements indicate the presence of two distinct aerosol layers, with a first one located between the surface and 1 km and a second one located above 1.5-4.0 km.

Wildfire smoke contains numerous hazardous air pollutants and many studies have documented population health effects from this exposure. Objectives: We aimed to assess the evidence of health effects from exposure to wildfire smoke and to identify susceptible populations. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature for studies of wildfire smoke exposure on mortality and on respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal health. Within those reviewed papers deemed to have minimal risk of bias, we assessed the coherence and consistency of findings. Discussion: Consistent evidence documents associations between wildfire smoke exposure and general respiratory health effects, specifically exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Growing evidence suggests associations with increased risk of respiratory infections and all-cause mortality. Evidence for cardiovascular effects is mixed, but a few recent studies have reported associations for specific cardiovascular end points. Insufficient research exists to identify specific population subgroups that are more susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure. Conclusions: Consistent evidence from a large number of studies indicates that wildfire smoke exposure is associated with respiratory morbidity with growing evidence supporting an association with all-cause mortality. More research is needed to clarify which causes of mortality may be associated with wildfire smoke, whether cardiovascular outcomes are associated with wildfire smoke, and if certain populations are more susceptible.","[Reid, Colleen E.; Jerrett, Michael; Balmes, John R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Environm Hlth Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Reid, Colleen E.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Harvard Ctr Populat & Dev Studies, Cambridge, MA USA; [Brauer, Michael; Elliott, Catherine T.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Johnston, Fay H.] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Johnston, Fay H.] US Dept HHS, Environm Hlth Serv, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Jerrett, Michael] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Balmes, John R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA USA; [Elliott, Catherine T.] Yukon Hlth & Social Serv, Off Chief Med Officer Hlth, Whitehorse, YT, Canada",,"Reid, CE (corresponding author), Harvard Ctr Populat & Dev Studies, 9 Bow St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",coreid@hsph.harvard.edu,,,,,,,362,365,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2016.0,124.0,9,,,,1334,1343,,10.1289/ehp.1409277,,,,,,,,WOS:000382530200011,

Forest management practices can affect diversity on various levels: genetic, species, and ecosystem. Understanding past natural disturbance dynamics and their level of dependence on human disturbances and management practices is essential for the conservation and management of FGR, especially in the light of climate change. In this review, forest management practices and their impact on genetic composition are reviewed, synthesized, and interpreted in the light of existing national and international forest monitoring schemes and concepts from various European projects. There is a clear need and mandate for forest genetic monitoring (FGM), while the requirements thereof lack complementarity with existing forest monitoring. Due to certain obstacles (e.g., the lack of unified FGM implementation procedures across the countries, high implementation costs, large number of indicators and verifiers for FGM proposed in the past), merging FGM with existing forest monitoring is complicated. Nevertheless, FGM is of paramount importance for forestry and the natural environment in the future, regardless of the presence or existence of other monitoring systems, as it provides information no other monitoring system can yield. FGM can provide information related to adaptive and neutral genetic diversity changes over time, on a species and/or on a population basis and can serve as an early warning system for the detection of potentially harmful changes of forest adaptability. In addition, FGM offers knowledge on the adaptive potential of forests under the changing environment, which is important for the long-term conservation of FGR.","[Kavaliauskas, Darius; Fussi, Barbara; Baier, Roland; Konnert, Monika] Bavarian Off Forest Seeding & Planting, Forstamtspl 1, D-83317 Teisendorf, Germany; [Westergren, Marjana; Finzgar, Domen; Bozic, Gregor; Kraigher, Hojka] Slovenian Forestry Inst, Vecna Pot 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Aravanopoulos, Filippos; Alizoti, Paraskevi; Avramidou, Evangelia] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Univ Campus, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",,"Kavaliauskas, D (corresponding author), Bavarian Off Forest Seeding & Planting, Forstamtspl 1, D-83317 Teisendorf, Germany.",darius.kavaliauskas@asp.bayern.de; barbara.fussi@asp.bayern.de; marjana.westergren@gozdis.si; aravanop@for.auth.gr; domen.finzgar@gozdis.si; roland.baier@npv-bgd.bayern.de; alizotp@for.auth.gr; gregor.bozic@gozdis.si; aevaggelia@yahoo.com; monika.konnert@gmx.de; hojka.kraigher@gozdis.si,,,,,,,10,11,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2018.0,9.0,3,,,,,,133,10.3390/f9030133,,,,,,,,WOS:000428508200036,

During its global circulation. Hg presents in a diversity of chemical forms and transforms between each other. Among Hg species, methylmercury (MeHg) is readily absorbed by humans via the aquatic food chain and thus it is very neurotoxic to exposed populations including fetuses due to perinatal exposure. In 2005, a survey was carried out in Temirtau, an Hg-contaminated site in North Central Kazakhstan, to investigate Hg concentrations in the hair samples of the residents and the relationship between Hg exposure levels and the related factors. Among the 289 hair samples, Hg concentrations ranged from 0.009 to 5.184 mu g/g with a mean of 0.577 mu g/g. Nearly 17% of the population exceeded 1 mu g/g for hair Hg, which corresponds to the reference of dose (RfD) 0.1 mu g/kg body weight/day developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Subgroups of males, people aged over 45 and fishermen or anglers were found to have elevated Hg exposure levels in their hair. A positive correlation was found between Hg concentrations in hair and frequencies of river fish consumption. As a result, the finding that people were exposed to high levels of Hg was expected due to the frequent consumption of fish caught from the polluted River Nura or the neighbouring lakes. A regression model showed that approximately 41% of variance of Hg concentrations in the study population's hair was attributed to the variables of gender, residential location, age and fishery occupation. The model implied that demographic characteristics together with dietary behaviour should be taken into account in studies associated with Hg exposure risk, in order to clearly define the group potentially sensitive to Hg exposure.

We investigated the effect of climate and basic soil properties on the accumulation of Cpyr in surface soils across the native North American prairies. Topsoil samples (0-10 cm) of 18 native grassland sites along temperature and precipitation transects from central Saskatoon, Canada, to south Texas, USA, were analyzed for benzenecarboxylic acids as molecular markers for Cpyr after nitric acid oxidation in the bulk soil (< 2 mm), clay- (< 2 mum) and silt-sized (2-20 mum) separates. C-pyr contributed between 4 and 18% to SOC, the <LF>major proportions of C-pyr being mostly found in the clay and silt fractions. Cpyr in soil did not correlate with basic inorganic soil properties such as pH or clay content, but it increased significantly as SOC contents increased (r(2) = 0.78; P < 0.001). Obviously, C-pyr co-accumulated with dead biomass. Since this accumulation depends on climate, also C-pyr contents in soil depend on climate and may be predicted by the logarithm of the ratio of mean annual temperature ( MAT) to mean annual precipitation (MAP) (P < 0.05). We conclude that the natural potential of soils to sequester C-pyr reflects both, (1) higher C-pyr production at sites with high plant biomass in moist climates, and (2) lower C-pyr residence time at soils acting as a CO2 source in warm climates.","Univ Bayreuth, Inst Soil Sci & Soil Geog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",,"Glaser, B (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Inst Soil Sci & Soil Geog, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",,,,,,,,121,126,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 5,2003.0,17.0,2,,,,,,1064,10.1029/2002GB002019,,,,,,,,WOS:000183554700001,

Charcoal was reported to be responsible for high soil organic matter contents and soil fertility of anthropogenic soils (Terra Preta) found in central Amazonia. Therefore, we reviewed the available information about the physical and chemical properties of charcoal as affected by different combustion procedures, and the effects of its application in agricultural fields on nutrient retention and crop production. Higher nutrient retention and nutrient availability were found after charcoal additions to soil, related to higher exchange capacity, surface area and direct nutrient additions. Higher charring temperatures generally improved exchange properties and surface area of the charcoal. Additionally, charcoal is relatively recalcitrant and can therefore be used as a long-term sink for atmospheric CO, Several aspects of a charcoal management system remain unclear, such as the role of microorganisms in oxidizing charcoal surfaces and releasing nutrients and the possibilities to improve charcoal properties during production under field conditions. Several research needs were identified, such as field testing of charcoal production in tropical agroecosystems, the investigation of surface properties of the carbonized materials in the soil environment, and the evaluation of the agronomic and economic effectiveness of soil management with charcoal.","Univ Bayreuth, Inst Soil Sci & Soil Geog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; Cornell Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Glaser, B (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Inst Soil Sci & Soil Geog, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",,,,,,,,1563,1865,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2002.0,35.0,4,,,,219,230,,10.1007/s00374-002-0466-4,,,,,,,,WOS:000176523500001,

The causative agent, hepatitis delta virus (HDV), is a unique human pathogen: it is the smallest known virus; it depends on HBV to disseminate its viroid-like RNA; it encodes only one protein (HDAg), which has both structural and regulatory functions; and it replicates using predominantly host proteins. The failure of HBV-specific nucleoside analogues to suppress the HBV helper function, and the limitations of experimental systems to study the HDV life cycle, have impeded the development of HDV-specific drugs. Thus, the only clinical regimen for HDV is IFN alpha, which shows some efficacy but long-term virological responses are rare. Insights into the receptor-mediated entry of HDV, and the observation that HDV assembly requires farnesyltransferase, have enabled novel therapeutic strategies to be developed. Interference with entry, for example through blockade of the HBV-HDV-specific receptor sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide NTCP by Myrcludex B, and inhibition of assembly by blockade of farnesyltransferase using lonafarnib or nucleic acid polymers such as REP 2139-Ca, have shown promising results in phase II studies.

With deforestation and degradation taking place throughout the tropics, improved understanding of the magnitude and spatial variation in deadwood is vital for the development of regional and global carbon budgets. However, this potentially important carbon pool is poorly quantified in Afrotropical forests and the regional drivers of deadwood stocks are unknown. In the first large-scale study of deadwood in Central Africa, we quantified stocks in 47 forest sites across Gabon and evaluated the effects of disturbance (logging), forest structure variables (live AGB, wood density, abundance of large trees), and abiotic variables (temperature, precipitation, seasonality). Average deadwood stocks (measured as necromass, the biomass of deadwood) were 65 Mg ha(-1) or 23% of live AGB. Deadwood stocks varied spatially with disturbance and forest structure, but not abiotic variables. Deadwood stocks increased significantly with logging (+ 38 Mg ha(-1)) and the abundance of large trees (+ 2.4 Mg ha(-1) for every tree > 60 cm dbh). Gabon holds 0.74 Pg C, or 21% of total aboveground carbon in deadwood, a threefold increase over previous estimates. Importantly, deadwood densities in Gabon are comparable to those in the Neotropics and respond similarly to logging, but represent a lower proportion of live AGB (median of 18% in Gabon compared to 26% in the Neotropics). In forest carbon accounting, necromass is often assumed to be a constant proportion (9%) of biomass, but in humid tropical forests this ratio varies from 2% in undisturbed forest to 300% in logged forest. Because logging significantly increases the deadwood carbon pool, estimates of tropical forest carbon should at a minimum use different ratios for logged (mean of 30%) and unlogged forests (mean of 18%).","[Carlson, Ben S.; Koerner, Sally E.; Medjibe, Vincent P.; Poulsen, John R.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, POB 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Medjibe, Vincent P.; White, Lee J.

While the carbon (C) cycle response to such perturbations has received considerable attention, potential responses of the soil nitrogen (N) cycle to changing organic matter inputs have been less well characterized. Changing litter inputs to surface to soils may alter the soil N cycle directly, by controlling N substrate availability, or indirectly, via interactions with soil C biogeochemistry. We investigated soil N-cycling responses to a leaf litter manipulation in a lowland tropical forest using isotopic and molecular techniques. Both removing and doubling leaf litter inputs decreased the size of the soil nitrate pool, gross nitrification rates, and the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Gross nitrification rates were correlated with the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea, and shifts in the N-cycling microbial community composition correlated with concurrent changes in edaphic properties, notably pH and C:N ratios. These results highlight the importance of understanding coupled biogeochemical cycles in global change scenarios and suggest that environmental perturbations that alter organic matter inputs in tropical forests could reduce inorganic N losses to surface waters and the atmosphere by limiting nitrate production.","[Wieder, William R.; Taylor, Philip G.; Nemergut, Diana R.; Hinckley, Eve-Lyn; Weintraub, Samantha R.; Martin, Mysti; Townsend, Alan R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cleveland, Cory C.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hinckley, Eve-Lyn] Natl Ecol Observ Network, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Philippot, Laurent; Bru, David] INRA, UMR 1229, Dept Soil & Environm Microbiol, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Philippot, Laurent; Bru, David] Univ Burgundy, Dept Soil & Environm Microbiol, UMR 1229, F-21000 Dijon, France",,"Wieder, WR (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, NCAR, CGD, TSS, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",wwieder@ucar.edu; cory.cleveland@umontana.edu; philip.taylor@colorado.edu; diana.nemergut@colorado.edu; ehinckley@neoninc.org; laurent.philippot@dijon.inra.fr; david.bru@dijon.inra.fr; samantha.weintraub@colorado.edu; mysti.martin@colorado.edu; alan.townsend@colorado.edu,,,,,,,37,38,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2013.0,113.0,1-3,,,,629,642,,10.1007/s10533-012-9793-1,,,,,,,,WOS:000317863300038,

Three critical limitations are: (1) the definition of methods and algorithms to accurately estimate forest age, (2) the provision of techniques that can yield accurate estimation of deforestation rates in both tropical dry and wet forest environments, and (3) the strong need to develop new approaches to link biophysical variables (e. g., leaf area index) to spectral reflectance to support spatially distributed carbon sequestration models. The validity of final estimates of carbon and carbon stock changes rests on complex issues at several levels, from the data themselves, to the analysis, interpretation, and validation of the data.

Compressed sensing (CS)-based image reconstruction methods decrease MR acquisition time by reconstructing high-quality images from data that were originally sampled at rates inferior to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Deep-learning methods have been used to solve the CS MR reconstruction problem. These proposed methods are able to quickly reconstruct images in a single pass using an appropriately trained network. A variety of different network architectures (e.g., U-nets and Residual U-nets) have been proposed to tackle the CS reconstruction problem. A drawback of these architectures is that they typically only work on image domain data. For undersampled data, the images computed by applying the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (iFFT) are aliased. In this work we propose a hybrid architecture, termed W-net, that works both in the k-space (or frequency-domain) and the image (or spatial) domains. Our network is composed of a complex-valued residual U-net in the k-space domain, an iFFT operation, and a real-valued U-net in the image domain. Our experiments demonstrated, using MR raw k-space data, that the proposed hybrid approach can potentially improve CS reconstruction compared to deep-learning networks that operate only in the image domain. In this study we compare our method with four previously published deep neural networks and examine their ability to reconstruct images that are subsequently used to generate regional volume estimates. Our technique was ranked second in the quantitative analysis, but qualitative analysis indicated that our reconstruction performed the best in hard to reconstruct regions, such as the cerebellum. All images reconstructed with our method were successfully post-processed, and showed good volumetry agreement compared with the fully sampled reconstruction measures.","[Souza, Roberto; Frayne, Richard] Univ Calgary, Hotchkiss Brain Inst, Radiol & Clin Neurosci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Souza, Roberto; Frayne, Richard] Foothills Med Ctr, Seaman Family MR Res Ctr, Calgary, AB, Canada",,"Souza, R (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Hotchkiss Brain Inst, Radiol & Clin Neurosci, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Souza, R (corresponding author), Foothills Med Ctr, Seaman Family MR Res Ctr, Calgary, AB, Canada.",roberto.medeirosdeso@ucalgary.ca; rfrayne@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,,2019.0,,,,,,257,264,,10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2019.00042,,,,,,,,WOS:000521826400034,

The unique attributes of P. vivax biology, particularly the capacity of the dormant liver stage, the hypnozoite, to maintain blood-stage infections even in the absence of active transmission, make blood-stage vaccines particularly attractive for this species. However, P. vivax vaccine development remains resolutely in first gear, with only a single blood-stage candidate having been evaluated in any depth. Experience with Plasmodium falciparum suggests that a much broader search for new candidates and a deeper understanding of high priority targets will be required to make significant advances. This review discusses some of the particular challenges of P. vivax blood-stage vaccine development, highlighting both recent advances and key remaining barriers to overcome in order to move development forward.

Some of these advancements involve using the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) by an entire canopy (fAPAR(canopy)) and/or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in modeling studies. In spite of these advancements, large uncertainties still remain. Zhang et al. (Remote Sens. Environ., 2005) [1] tried to mitigate some of these uncertainties with the concept of using fAPAR that is restricted to the foliage chlorophyll (fAPAR(chl)) instead of the entire canopy. In this current study, we calculated fAPAR(canopy), fAPAR(chl), and foliage non-chlorophyll fAPAR (fAPAR(non-chl)) for the Harvard Forest using a radiative transfer model and multi-temporal Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion satellite images. The canopy-level proportions of foliar chlorophyll and non-chlorophyll absorption were determined at different seasons (spring, summer, autumn) in an effort to demonstrate temporal variations of three plant functional types: deciduous forest, coniferous forest, and grass. Comparisons were made for NDVI versus fAPAR and for the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) versus fAPAR(chl). In addition, EO-1 Hyperion images were utilized to simulate these new fAPAR(canopy), fAPAR(chl), and fAPAR(non-chl) products at 60 m as prototypes for the proposed NASA HyspIRI satellite spectrometer. These products should prove useful for future terrestrial carbon cycle and ecosystem studies.","[Zhang, Qingyuan] Univ Space Res Assoc, Columbia, MD 21044 USA; [Zhang, Qingyuan; Middleton, Elizabeth M.; Cheng, Yen-Ben; Landis, David R.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Biospher Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Cheng, Yen-Ben] Earth Resources Technol, Laurel, MD 20707 USA; [Landis, David R.] Sigma Space Corp, Lanham, MD 20706 USA",,"Zhang, QY (corresponding author), Univ Space Res Assoc, Columbia, MD 21044 USA.",qyz72@yahoo.com,,,,,,,27,28,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2013.0,6.0,5,,,,2254,2264,,10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2275176,,,,,,,,WOS:000325757300016,

These animals represented all of the C. albifrons's taxa described by Hershkovitz (1949) in Colombia and Peru (10 out of 13 subspecies are described by this author). The sequences analyzed demonstrate the existence of three well defined groups in northern Colombia (trans-Andean): malitosus, versicolor-pleei-cesarae and leucocephalus. They arose from at least, three distinct migrations from different Amazonian groups. Five different Amazonian and Eastern Llanos C albifrons's groups (I, II, III, IV, and V) were also found. In many Amazonian localities, some of these groups live in sympatry probably by secondary expansion after their respective formations. Amazonian group I is closely related to the versicolor-pleei-cesarae group, malitosus is closely related to Amazonian group V, while leucocephalus is closely related to Amazonian group IV. Nevertheless, our genetic analysis could not resolve the genetic relationships among the main C albifrons groups. The p-statistic applied to the median-joining network yielded that the major part of the temporal splits estimated occurred in the Pleistocene, reinforcing the importance of the Pleistocene refugia during the evolution of C. albifrons.

Top-down approaches based on inverse calculations with CO2 concentrations and atmospheric transport models are problematic because of a paucity of air samples and poor constraints on regional air transport. Direct measurements of changes in aboveground biomass suggest a net carbon sink in old-growth forests but remain controversial. Direct measurements of CO2 flux with the eddy covariance technique indicate forests to be both sources and sinks of carbon, depending in part on when the last disturbance occurred. These flux measurements may be extrapolated through time and space with ecosystem models based on physiological processes, but many models fail to reproduce even the correct sign of carbon balance observed seasonally in some forests. Models based on changes in forest structure, driven by both anthropogenic (e.g., deforestation for pasture) and natural (e.g., fire) disturbances and recovery, consistently calculate net carbon emissions, emissions that may be offset by the increased biomass observed in long-term plots in old-growth forests. Aquatic systems are nearly neutral with respect to carbon, with inputs from seasonally flooded forests and grasslands accounting for the measured efflux. Taken together, these different approaches, which often consider different components of the region's carbon cycle, suggest that Amazonia has been, on average, nearly neutral with respect to carbon over the last decade, albeit a small net source during El Nino events.","[Houghton, R.

This central role is largely the result of the possibilities to map and characterize land cover based on observations and remote sensing. This paper argues that more attention should be given to land use and land functions and linkages between these. Consideration of land functions that provide a wide range of goods and services makes more integrated assessments of land change possible. The increasing attention to multifunctional land use is another incentive to develop methods to assess changes in land functions. A number of methods to quantify and map the spatial extent of land use and land functions are discussed and the implications for modeling are identified based on recent model approaches in land change science. The mixed use of land cover, land use and land function in maps and models leads to inconsistencies in land change assessments. Explicit attention to the non-linear relations between land cover, land use and land function is essential to consistently address land change. New methods to map and quantify land function dynamics will enhance our ability to understand and model land system change and adequately inform policies and planning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

As a consequence, there is a widespread demand for accurate and long-term quantitative observations of their distribution over the whole globe. This study presents the first global data set that quantifies the monthly distribution of surface water extent at similar to 25 km sampling intervals over 12 years (1993-2004). These estimates, generated from complementary multiple-satellite observations, including passive (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) and active (ERS scatterometer) microwaves along with visible and near-infrared imagery (advanced very high-resolution radiometer; AVHRR), were first developed over 1993-2000. The ERS encountered technical problems in 2001 and the processing scheme had to be adapted to extend the time series. Here we investigate and discuss the adjustments of the methodology, compare the various options, and show that the data set can be extended with good confidence beyond 2000, using ERS and AVHRR mean monthly climatologies. In addition to a large seasonal and interannual variability, the new results show a slight overall decrease in global inundated area between 1993 and 2004, representing an similar to 5.7% reduction of the mean annual maximum in 12 years. The decrease is mainly observed in the tropics during the 1990s. Over inland water bodies and large river basins, we assess the variability of the surface water extent against related variables such as in situ river discharges, altimeter-derived and in situ river/floodplain water level heights, and precipitation estimates. This new 12 year data set of global surface water extent represents an unprecedented source of information for future hydrological or methane modeling.","[Papa, F.; Rossow, W.

All the current Lagothrix forms probably descended from the ancestor L. poeppigii or perhaps (less probably) that of L. lugens. We detected at least 2 lineages in L. poeppigii. L. cana and L. lagotricha were determined to be monophyletic and had lower gene diversity levels compared to L. poeppigii and L. lugens. The most basal ancestors of the current L. poeppigii lineages diverged from the other Lagothrix taxa around 2.5 million years ago, at the end of the Pliocene or at the beginning of the Pleistocene. Clearly, L. cana and L. lagotricha were the 2 most recently derived Lagothrix taxa. The diversification within L. lugens and L. poeppigii may coincide with the first and second Pleistocene glacial periods, respectively, while the diversification within L. cana and L. lagotricha could have occurred in the last 400,000 years, coinciding with the climatological changes provoked by the Illinois-Riss (third) and Wisconsin-Wurm (fourth) glaciations.

Although preliminary results of Sargassum distributions in the nearby oceans have been obtained using measurements from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), MERIS stopped functioning in 2012, and detecting and quantifying Sargassum distributions still face technical challenges due to ambiguous pixels from clouds, cloud shadows, cloud adjacency effect, and large-scale image gradient. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to detect Sargassum presence and to quantify Sargassum coverage using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) alternative floating algae index (AFAI), which examines the red-edge reflectance of floating vegetation. This approach includes three basic steps: 1) classification of Sargassum-containing pixels through correction of large-scale gradient, masking clouds and cloud shadows, and removal of ambiguous pixels; 2) linear unmixing of Sargassum-containing pixels; and, 3) statistics of Sargassum area coverage in pre-defined grids at monthly, seasonal, and annual intervals. In the absence of direct field measurements to validate the results, limited observations from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) measurements and numerous local reports support the conclusion that the elevated AFA1 signals are due to the presence of Sargassum instead of other floating materials, and various sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the uncertainties in the derived Sargassum area coverage. The approach was applied to MODIS observations between 2000 and 2015 over the Central West Atlantic (CWA) region (0-22 degrees N, 63-38 degrees W) to derive the spatial and temporal distribution patterns as well as the total area coverage of Sargassum. Results indicate that the first widespread Sargassum distribution event occurred in 2011, consistent with previous MERIS findings. Since 2011, only 2013 showed a minimal Sargassum coverage similar to the period of 2000 to 2010; all other years showed significantly more coverage. More alarmingly, the summer months of 2015 showed mean coverage of >2000 km(2), or about 4 times of the summer 2011 coverage and 20 times of the summer 2000 to 2010 coverage. Analysis of several environmental variables provided some hints on the reasons causing the inter-annual changes after 2010, yet further multi-disciplinary research (including in situ measurements) is required to understand such changes and long-term trends in Sargassum coverage.

The efficiency of the photodynamic effect appears to be particularly high in sinking particles collected under sea ice and is attributed to the rapid settling of highly aggregated sympagic algae to depths of low light transmission favouring the photodynamic effect at the expense of photobleaching of the sensitizer. Paradoxically, the low efficiency of Type II photosensitized oxidation of lipids observed in temperate and equatorial regions is associated with high solar irradiances in these regions. Type II photosensitized oxidation of lipids in senescent phytoplankton seems thus to be strongly dependent of the intensity of solar irradiance. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.
